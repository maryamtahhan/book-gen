## Chapter 155: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tftp/jumpstarter_driver_tftp/server_test.py

 This chapter discusses the purpose and functionality of the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tftp/jumpstarter_driver_tFTP/server_test.py`. This module is responsible for testing the TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server implementation in the Jumpstarter project.

   The `tftp_server` fixture sets up a temporary directory, creates an instance of the TftpServer class with this directory as its root path, and starts the server on a dynamically assigned port. After starting the server, it waits for the server to bind to a port before yielding the server instance, temp directory, and server's listening port number.

   The `create_test_client` function creates an asynchronous datagram endpoint that represents a TFTP client connecting to the server. This is used in subsequent test functions to send requests to the server and verify its responses.

   Several test functions are defined, each testing specific aspects of the TftpServer's functionality:

   - `test_server_startup_and_shutdown` checks that the server starts up and shuts down cleanly.
   - `test_read_request_for_existing_file` verifies that reading an existing file from the server works correctly.
   - `test_read_request_for_nonexistent_file` ensures that attempting to read a non-existent file returns an appropriate error.
   - `test_write_request_rejection` checks that write requests are rejected, as this server is meant to be read-only.
   - `test_invalid_packet_handling` verifies that the server can handle and discard malformed packets.
   - `test_path_traversal_prevention` ensures that path traversal attempts are blocked by the server.
   - `test_options_negotiation` checks that options (blksize, timeout) are properly negotiated between the client and the server.
   - `test_retry_mechanism` tests the server's retry mechanism for lost packets during data transfer.
   - `test_invalid_options_handling` verifies that the server can handle invalid options in requests without raising errors.

   These test functions help maintain the quality of the TftpServer implementation and ensure it functions correctly as part of the larger Jumpstarter project.

        participant T as TFTP Test Client
        participant S as TFTP Server

        Note over T, S: Given a TFTPServer instance running on 127.0.0.1 with a test file "test.txt" in temp directory

        activate T
        T->>S: Send RRQ packet for test.txt
        deactivate T

        Note over S: Parse request, check if file exists and negotiate options

        activate S
        S-->>T: Reply with ACK packet
        deactivate S

        Note over T: Receive ACK, send Data Request (DATA) packets for each block of the file

        activate T
        T->>S: Send DATA request packets for test.txt blocks
        deactivate T

        Note over S: Read data from temp directory and respond with DATA packets

        activate S
        S-->>T: Respond with DATA packets containing file data
        deactivate S

        activate T
        T->>S: Send ACK packet for each block received
        deactivate T

        Note over S: Receive ACKs, write data to temp directory and send final ACK when all blocks have been sent

        activate S
        S-->>T: Respond with final ACK
        deactivate S

        activate T
        T->>S: Close the connection
        deactivate T

        Note over S: Close the connection
