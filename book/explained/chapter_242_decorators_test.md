## Chapter 242: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/driver/decorators_test.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/driver/decorators_test.py` is a unit test module for the decorator functions defined in the `jumpstarter/decorators.py` file within the same package, as part of the Jumpstarter project. The purpose of this test module is to ensure the correct functioning and behavior of the custom decorators that are used to mark various types of functions and methods in the Jumpstarter library.

   The test file imports necessary modules and classes from other parts of the package, including the `export` function and three marker decorator constants: `MARKER_DRIVERCALL`, `MARKER_MAGIC`, and `MARKER_STREAMING_DRIVERCALL`. These decorators are applied to various function and method declarations in the Jumpstarter library to specify their intended use, such as driver functions or streaming functions.

   The test file defines a `Functions` class with several methods that have been decorated using the `@export` decorator. This decorator ensures that these methods can be exported from the module and made available for import by other parts of the library. The test function, `test_driver_decorators()`, tests the behavior of the marker decorators on the exported functions and methods in the `Functions` class.

   Within the `test_driver_decorators()` function, several assertions are made to ensure that the correct marker decorator has been applied to each function or method based on its type (e.g., sync function, async function, generator). Additionally, a test is included to check that an error is raised when attempting to export a non-instance object.

   This code fits into the overall Jumpstarter project as a part of the testing infrastructure, ensuring the proper functioning and behavior of the custom decorators used throughout the library. The test results help maintain the quality and consistency of the library, making it easier for developers to use and extend in their own projects. Example use cases would involve applying these decorators to functions and methods within the Jumpstarter library that interact with various components such as drivers or data streams.
