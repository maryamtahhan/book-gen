## Chapter 39: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/__init__.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/__init__.py` serves as the entry point for the command-line interface (CLI) of JumpStarter, a versatile blockchain development toolkit. This module is responsible for initializing and managing various functionalities provided by the CLI.

Upon execution, the script performs several tasks:

1. Importing necessary libraries, including `os` and the `truststore`.
2. Checking if the current operating system is macOS (as indicated by `os.uname().sysname`), or if the environment variable `JUMPSTARTER_FORCE_SYSTEM_CERTS` is set to "1". If either of these conditions is met, it calls the `truststore.inject_into_ssl()` function, which injects system certificates into SSL to prevent potential security issues (as outlined in this GitHub issue: https://github.com/jumpstarter-dev/jumpstarter/issues/362).

This code is crucial for the overall functioning of JumpStarter CLI, as it ensures that system certificates are properly managed when running on macOS or when forced by an environment variable. This not only improves security but also makes the tool more reliable in various use cases, such as interacting with blockchain networks and smart contracts.

Example use case: Suppose a developer is using JumpStarter CLI to deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum network from their macOS machine. Without this code, there might be certificate-related issues when making HTTPS requests, which could lead to connection errors or security vulnerabilities. By including this script at the beginning of the CLI's execution, JumpStarter ensures that system certificates are properly injected into SSL, thus enabling smooth and secure interactions with the Ethereum network.
