## Chapter 171: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-imagehash/jumpstarter_imagehash/imagehash.py

 This chapter focuses on the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-imagehash/jumpstarter_imagehash/imagehash.py` file, a critical component within the JumpStarter project. The module serves for image hashing and comparison, ensuring visual consistency between frames or images from different instances or times.

   **Overview**

   The `ImageHash` class is the primary object in this module. It accepts a `DriverClient` object as its first parameter, which provides a snapshot method to fetch an image from the video input source. The remaining parameters define where the actual image files should be stored (defaulting to the current working directory), the hash function used for hashing images, and the size of the hash generated.

   **Important Functions/Classes**

   - `snapshot()`: Fetches a snapshot image from the video input source using the associated `DriverClient` object's snapshot method.
   - `hash_snapshot()`: Generates a hash value for the snapshot image using the specified hash function from the imagehash library. By default, this is set to `average_hash`.
   - `assert_snapshot(self, reference_img_file, tolerance=1)`: Asserts that the current snapshot image matches the provided reference image (specified by `reference_img_file`). If the images are not identical, it raises an `AssertionError`, optionally appending "FAILED_" to the reference file name and saving a copy of the snapshot image.
   - `_snapshot_diff(self, reference_img_file, hash_func=imagehash.average_hash, hash_size=8)`: Compares the provided reference image (`reference_img_file`) to the current snapshot image, returning the difference between their respective hashes and a copy of the snapshot image.

   **Project Context**

   The `ImageHash` class is used within the JumpStarter project for testing video processing pipelines. By comparing the snapshots generated by different drivers at various points in time, developers can ensure that the same input results in the same output regardless of the source. This ensures a consistent experience across all supported devices or scenarios.

   **Example Use Cases**

   - Comparing snapshots from two separate video inputs to confirm they are visually identical:

      ```python
      image_hasher = ImageHash(your_driver_client)
      snapshot1 = image_hasher.snapshot()
      snapshot2 = image_hasher.snapshot()
      assert image_hasher.assert_snapshot("reference_image.png")
      ```

   - Comparing snapshots from a single video input at two different points in time to ensure consistency:

      ```python
      image_hasher = ImageHash(your_driver_client)
      snapshot1 = image_hasher.snapshot()
      # Advance the video using your driver client's API...
      snapshot2 = image_hasher.snapshot()
      assert image_hasher.assert_snapshot("reference_image.png")
      ```

       participant DriverClient as DC
       participant ImageHash as IH
       participant ImageHashFunction as IHF
       participant PILImage as PI

       Note over IH: ImageHash class initializes with a DriverClient object
       DC->>IH: Provide snapshot method
       IH->>IH: Call snapshot method and get PILImage
       IH->>IHF: Invoke hash_func from imagehash library on PILImage
       Note over IH: Get ImageHash (hash value)

       Note over IH: User can call assert_snapshot with a reference image file name
       IH->>IHF: Invoke hash_func from imagehash library on reference image
       Note over IH: Compare the hash values of snapshot and reference images
       IH->>IH: If the difference is greater than tolerance, raise AssertionError
       IH->>DC: Save the snapshot image if the comparison fails
   ```

This sequence diagram represents how the `ImageHash` class interacts with its dependencies. It shows that the class initializes with a `DriverClient` object, which provides a snapshot method. The class then uses this method to generate an Image (PIL) and compares its hash value with a reference image's hash value using an `ImageHashFunction`. If the difference between the hashes is greater than a specified tolerance, it raises an AssertionError and saves the snapshot image.
