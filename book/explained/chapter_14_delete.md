## Chapter 14: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/delete.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/delete.py` is a part of the command line interface (CLI) for managing Jumpstarter Kubernetes objects, specifically deleting client and exporter objects from the Kubernetes cluster.

   The file contains two main functions: `delete_client()` and `delete_exporter()`, each represented as commands in the `@click.group(cls=AliasedGroup)` declaration. These functions are responsible for interacting with the Kubernetes API to delete objects and handling exceptions that may occur during this process.

   The `delete_client()` function takes in arguments such as namespace, kubeconfig, context, name (optional), output format, nointeractive flag, and a flag to delete the client configuration file if set. Similarly, the `delete_exporter()` function accepts similar arguments for deleting exporters.

   These functions fit into the project by providing a way to manage Kubernetes objects through the command line, allowing users to interact with their deployed Jumpstarter configurations easily.

   Example use cases include:
   - `jumpstarter-cli delete client myclient`: Deletes a client object named 'myclient' from the default namespace in the current kubeconfig context.
   - `jumpstarter-cli delete exporter myexporter --delete`: Deletes an exporter object named 'myexporter' from the default namespace in the current kubeconfig context and also deletes the associated configuration file for the exporter.

   The functions make use of several other modules, such as `AliasedGroup`, `opt_context`, `opt_kubeconfig`, `opt_namespace`, and others, which are part of the project's common CLI utilities. These modules help in parsing command-line arguments and handling various options for the commands.
