## Chapter 103: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/driver_test.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/driver_test.py` is a test suite for the network drivers within the JumpStarter project. It includes several functions to test different aspects of the TcpNetwork, UdpNetwork, UnixNetwork, and WebsocketNetwork classes.

   Important functions and classes in this file include:

   - `echo_handler`: An asynchronous function used as a handler for network streams to echo back any received data.
   - `TcpPortforwardAdapter`, `UnixPortforwardAdapter`, `TemporaryUnixListener`: Adapters that create port forwarding connections for TCP and UNIX sockets, and a utility class to create temporary UNIX listeners.
   - Various test functions (e.g., `test_tcp_network_portforward`, `test_unix_network_portforward`, etc.) that exercise the functionality of the network drivers by establishing connections, sending data, and verifying the expected results.
   - Some test functions also include performance tests using tools like iperf3 to measure throughput and latency between the client and server connections.
   - `test_dbus_network_system` and `test_dbus_network_session`: Tests that verify the connection and usage of D-Bus network drivers in both system and session bus environments, respectively. These tests make use of patch decorators to mock certain dependencies like `busctl`.
   - `test_websocket_network_connect`: A test that verifies the ability to connect to a WebSocket server using the WebsocketNetwork driver.

   The code in this file helps ensure that the network drivers are functioning correctly and consistently, allowing for reliable communication between JumpStarter components. Example use cases might include data exchange between different processes or machines, or setting up and tearing down connections to D-Bus services.

This mermaid sequence diagram visualizes the interactions between the different functions in the provided Python script. It shows how a user starts tests for various network types (TCP, Unix, UDP) by creating and connecting to a network instance, and how data is exchanged between these connections.
