## Chapter 143: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-snmp/jumpstarter_driver_snmp/client.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-snmp/jumpstarter_driver_snmp/client.py` file, a custom SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) client is implemented as an extension to the existing power control driver found in the `jumpstarter_driver_power` package. This new client class, named `SNMPServerClient`, inherits from and extends the functionality of the base `PowerClient` class.

   The primary function of this SNMP client is to provide a user-friendly interface for controlling power on/off using SNMP commands. It achieves this by defining two methods, `on()` and `off()`, which respectively issue the "on" and "off" SNMP commands through the client.

   To enable users to interact with the client from the command line, a Click group is defined within the class using the `cli()` method. This group serves as a collection of subcommands, which includes all the available commands inherited from the base `PowerClient`. The purpose of this design is to make it easy for users to execute both the existing power control commands and the new SNMP-specific commands in a unified manner.

   Within the project, the `SNMPServerClient` fits into the driver system as an extension of the PowerControl driver that supports controlling power via SNMP instead of traditional means like GPIO or USB.

   Example use cases include situations where devices have SNMP support but not other common interfaces for power control, and it is necessary to control these devices through a network using SNMP commands. Users can interact with the client from the command line by issuing either regular power control commands or the new SNMP-specific commands. For instance:

   ```
   jumpstarter snmp on
   ```
   turns on the device via SNMP, while

   ```
   jumpstarter off
   ```
   would turn it off using the default method (e.g., GPIO or USB) if available.

      participant User as User
      participant SNMPClient as SNMP Client
      participant SNMPServer as SNMP Server

      User->>SNMPClient: on/off command
      SNMPClient->>SNMPServer: GET/SET request (snmpget/snmpset)
      SNMPServer-->>SNMPClient: Response
      SNMPClient-->>User: Result of the operation
   ```

This diagram illustrates that a User interacts with an SNMPClient, which in turn communicates with an SNMPServer using SNMP protocol (GET/SET requests). The result of the operation is then sent back to the User by the SNMPClient.
