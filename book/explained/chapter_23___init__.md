 Chapter Title: Understanding `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/__init__.py`

In the context of the Jumpstarter project, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/__init__.py` serves as a fundamental building block for the command-line interface (CLI) components. This Python module lays the groundwork for several common functionalities shared across various CLI tools within the Jumpstarter ecosystem.

The primary purpose of this file is to define essential classes, functions, and variables that will be used throughout other modules in the `jumpstarter-cli-common` package. Here are some key components found within:

1. Classes:
   - `JumpstarterCLICommonException`: A custom exception class for handling specific exceptions related to the CLI tools.
   - `JumpstarterCLI`: The base class for all command-line interfaces in Jumpstarter. It provides a standardized structure and functionality for parsing arguments, initializing objects, and executing commands.
   - `JumpstarterCommand`: A subclass of the parent `JumpstarterCLI` class designed to represent individual commands within the CLI tools.

2. Functions:
   - `init_logger()`: Initializes a logger instance, which is used for logging messages and errors throughout the CLI tools.
   - `get_options()`: Parses command-line arguments and returns an options dictionary, containing key-value pairs based on the provided flags and arguments.
   - `validate_options(options)`: Validates the parsed options against expected schemas or validations for each specific command.

3. Variables:
   - `__version__`: Contains the version number of the CLI tools, typically used for displaying the version when executing a command with --version flag.

The code within this file sets the foundation for maintaining consistent design patterns and behaviors across all CLI tools in Jumpstarter. Each tool can leverage these shared functionalities, ensuring developers focus on implementing task-specific logic rather than rebuilding basic infrastructure.

For example, consider a simple command named "deploy" that deploys an application using Jumpstarter. The DeployCommand class would inherit from the JumpstarterCommand class, overriding necessary methods to implement deploy-specific behaviors while reusing the parsing and logging functionality provided by the base class.

By understanding the purpose and functionality of `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/__init__.py`, you can effectively contribute to the development and maintenance of command-line tools within the Jumpstarter project, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and a delightful user experience.

participant User as User
participant CLI as CLI
participant Common as Common

User->>CLI: Run command
CLI-->Common: Import common module
CLI->>Common: Call function (e.g. init, run, etc.)
Common-->>CLI: Perform action (e.g. initialization, execution, etc.)
CLI-->>User: Display result or progress
```

This sequence diagram represents the interaction between a User, CLI (Command Line Interface), and Common module in the `jumpstarter-cli-common` package. The user runs a command via the CLI, which in turn imports and interacts with the Common module to execute its functions and display results or progress back to the user.
