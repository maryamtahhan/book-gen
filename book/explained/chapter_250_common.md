## Chapter 250: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/streams/common.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/streams/common.py` module, you'll find a set of functions and classes for handling data streams asynchronously. This code facilitates communication between different processes or components within the Jumpstarter project, which is primarily focused on building decentralized applications (dApps).

   The main function in this module is `copy_stream()`, an asynchronous method that copies data from one stream (`src`) to another (`dst`). This function catches certain exceptions related to broken or closed resources, invalid state errors, and other specific asyncio errors. If the copy process completes successfully, it sends an end-of-file signal (EOF) to the destination stream.

   The `forward_stream()` function is a context manager that asynchronously forwards data between two streams in both directions. It creates a task group and starts two concurrent tasks: one to copy data from `a` to `b`, and another to copy data from `b` to `a`. This ensures bidirectional communication between the two streams.

   Lastly, the `create_memory_stream()` function generates a pair of memory-bound object streams, each consisting of a transmitter (tx) and receiver (rx). These pairs are then wrapped in `StapledObjectStream` instances to facilitate bi-directional communication. This function is useful when you want to create temporary data streams for testing or other purposes within the project.

   In summary, this module provides essential functionality for handling asynchronous data streams, enabling the efficient exchange of data between different components within the Jumpstarter project. Example use cases might include communicating between smart contract calls and their underlying services or facilitating communication between different dApp modules.

      participant B as Function B (forward_stream(a, b))
      participant C as Function C (copy_stream(dst, src))

      A->>B: Assign values to a and b from create_memory_stream()
      B->>C: Call copy_stream(a, b)
      B->>C: Call copy_stream(b, a)
      C->>A.tx: Send data from src to dst
      C->>B.rx: Receive data from src on b
      C->>A.rx: Receive data from src on a
      A.tx->>C: Data sent by a is received by copy_stream
      A.rx->>C: Data sent by a is received by copy_stream
      B.tx->>C: Data sent by b is received by copy_stream
      B.rx->>C: Data sent by b is received by copy_stream
      C->>A.tx: Send EOF to src
      A.tx->>C: EOF sent by a is received by copy_stream
      B.rx->>C: EOF sent by b is received by copy_stream
      C->>B: End of the sequence diagram
