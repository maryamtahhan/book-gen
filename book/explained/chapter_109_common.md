## Chapter 109: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-opendal/jumpstarter_driver_opendal/common.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-opendal/jumpstarter_driver_opendal/common.py` file, we define a series of classes and functions that facilitate working with the OpenDAL (Opensource Data Access Layer) library in the context of the JumpStarter project.

   The `EntryMode`, `Metadata`, `PresignedRequest`, and `Capability` classes are all derived from the Pydantic library, allowing for type hinting and data validation within the codebase. These classes aim to simplify interaction with the underlying OpenDAL storage system by providing convenient interfaces to common operations like reading, writing, listing, and more.

   - `EntryMode`: Represents an entry in the file system, whether it is a file or a directory.
   - `Metadata`: Contains metadata information about a file, such as content length, disposition, and MIME type.
   - `PresignedRequest`: Encapsulates a presigned HTTP request that can be used to access files without sharing sensitive credentials.
   - `Capability`: Represents the available capabilities for different operations on the storage system, such as reading, writing, listing, and others.

   This code fits within the JumpStarter driver for OpenDAL by providing a consistent interface between various storage backends and the main JumpStarter application. By abstracting away the complexities of interacting with different storage systems, this code allows developers to focus on building their project without having to worry about the intricacies of each specific backend.

   Example use cases could include:
   - Creating a file in the storage system using `capability.write = True` and providing other relevant options like content type or disposition.
   - Listing all files in a directory using `capability.list = True`.
   - Reading metadata about a specific file using `capability.stat = True`.
   - Delegating access to a specific file with a presigned URL using the `PresignedRequest` class.

This Mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the `JumpstarterDriver`, `DataStorage` (representing your storage backend), `Capability`, `Metadata`, and `PresignedRequest`. The arrows represent method calls, and the boxes contain the participants in the interaction. This diagram showcases how key functions like reading, statting, copying, and listing interact with the underlying data storage service using various capabilities and metadata, including presigned requests for delegated access.
