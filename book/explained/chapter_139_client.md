## Chapter 139: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-shell/jumpstarter_driver_shell/client.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-shell/jumpstarter_driver_shell/client.py` file, a custom client class called `ShellClient` is defined, which interacts with a shell driver. This file provides an interface for dynamically calling methods in the shell driver and handling the output from those method calls.

The primary functionality of this file revolves around the `ShellClient` class, which inherits from the base `DriverClient` class. The key aspects of this class are:

- `_methods` (optional) - A list containing the methods supported by the driver. If this attribute is not provided during instantiation, it will be populated upon calling the `get_methods()` method on the driver.
- `_check_method_exists(self, method)` - This function checks whether the specified method exists in the list of available driver methods. If the method does not exist, it raises an `AttributeError`.
- `__getattr__(self, name)` - This special method is called when an attribute or method of this class is accessed and cannot be found. It dynamically checks if the method exists in the supported driver methods list using `_check_method_exists()`, and if it does, it defines a lambda function that calls the method on the driver with the provided arguments and returns the output as a tuple (stdout, stderr, returncode).

In the project, this `ShellClient` class is used to interact with a shell driver. It allows you to call various methods in the shell driver dynamically and handle the results without explicitly defining each method call separately in your code.

Example use cases:

1. To execute a command on the shell driver and get the output, create an instance of `ShellClient` and call the method with the desired command as an attribute:

```python
shell_client = ShellClient(url='<driver_url>')
output = shell_client.command('ls -l /home')
print(output)
```

2. To define a custom method in the shell driver and call it using `ShellClient`, first, create the method on the shell driver:

```bash
def my_custom_method(arg1, arg2):
    # shell command implementation goes here

# Register the method in the shell driver configuration
{ 'my_custom_method': my_custom_method }
```

Then, call the method using `ShellClient`:

```python
shell_client = ShellClient(url='<driver_url>')
output = shell_client.my_custom_method('arg1', 'arg2')
print(output)
```

 ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
      participant Driver as Driver
      participant ShellClient as ShellClient
      ShellClient->>Driver: get_methods()
      Driver-->>ShellClient: [_methods]

      note over Driver: Stores list of available methods

      ShellClient->>Driver: call_method(name, kwargs, *args)
      loop for each method
        Driver->>ShellClient: (stdout, stderr, returncode)
      end
      ShellClient-->>+ShellClient: (stdout, stderr, returncode)
   ```

This mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between the `Driver` and the `ShellClient`. The `get_methods()` function is called once by the `ShellClient` to get the list of available methods from the `Driver`. Each time a method is dynamically accessed via the magic method `__getattr__`, the `call_method()` function is invoked on the `Driver`, and the results are returned back to the `ShellClient`.
