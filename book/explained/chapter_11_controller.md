## Chapter 11: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/controller.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin` module, the file `controller.py` is a crucial component responsible for managing and updating the version of the Jumpstarter CLI (Command Line Interface). This code is primarily designed to fetch and determine the latest compatible version of the controller based on the current client version.

   The main function in this file is `async def get_latest_compatible_controller_version(client_version: str | None = None)`. This asynchronous function fetches the list of available tagged versions for the Jumpstarter Helm repository from Quay.io, parses each version, and checks their compatibility with the given client version. If a compatible version is found, it returns that version as a string; otherwise, it raises an exception.

   The function takes an optional `client_version` parameter, which can be either a string or None. If provided, it uses this value to determine the compatible versions. Otherwise, it fetches the current client version using another utility function (`get_client_version()`).

   This code fits into the project's larger ecosystem by providing a way for the Jumpstarter CLI Admin tool to update itself whenever necessary. By utilizing semantic versioning principles and asynchronous networking via `aiohttp`, it ensures efficient and reliable version handling.

   Example use cases of this code could be:

   - When a user runs the command `jumpstarter-admin update` in their terminal, the function is called to check for an updated version of the controller and download it if one is available.
   - In a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, where the CLI needs to be kept up-to-date across various environments.

       else

       end

       C-->>Cl: str(selected) (Latest compatible Controller Version)
   ```

This sequence diagram represents how the key functions interact in the provided Python code. The client sends its version to the controller, which fetches the available controller versions from an API, checks compatibility, selects the latest compatible version, and returns it back to the client.
