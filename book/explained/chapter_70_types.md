## Chapter 70: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-corellium/jumpstarter_driver_corellium/corellium/types.py

 This chapter focuses on the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-corellium/jumpstarter_driver_corellium/corellium/types.py` file, which is a crucial part of the JumpStarter project. The purpose of this file is to define data structures and classes that will interact with Corellium's API, specifically for handling projects, devices, and instances.

   The file includes three main classes: `Project`, `Device`, and `Instance`. Each class represents a different entity within the Corellium ecosystem.

1. **Project**: This dataclass is used to represent a Corellium project. It holds two attributes: id (a unique identifier for the project) and name (the user-defined name of the project).

2. **Device**: The `Device` class represents a virtual device within Corellium's infrastructure. It contains various properties like name, type, flavor, description, model, peripherals status, and quotas. This information allows you to create virtual instances with specific configurations.

3. **Instance**: The `Instance` dataclass is used for virtual instances created on Corellium devices. An instance object has an id and a state attribute (which indicates the current status of the instance).

These classes play a vital role in our project by providing a clear structure to interact with Corellium's API, allowing users to create, manage, and utilize virtual devices efficiently.

For example, when using the JumpStarter project, you might do something like this:

```python
# Create a new project
project = Project("My First Project", "my_unique_id")

# Define a device configuration
device_config = Device(
    "My Device Name",
    "iPhone",
    "iOS 15",
    "My custom description",
    "iPhone 13 Pro Max",
    True,  # peripherals enabled
    {"cpu": 4, "ram": 4096}  # quotas for CPU and RAM
)

# Create a new instance based on the device configuration
instance = Instance(create_new_instance(device_config))
```

 ```mermaid

participant Project as Project
participant Device as Device
participant Instance as Instance

Project->>Device: get_devices()
Device-->>Project: returns list of Devices

Project->>Instance: create_instance(Device)
Instance-->>Project: returns Instance or error message

Instance->>Device: start()
Device-->>Instance: starts the device

Instance->>Device: stop()
Device-->>Instance: stops the device
```

This diagram represents the interaction between the `Project`, `Device`, and `Instance` classes. The `Project` class gets a list of devices using the `get_devices()` method, and it can create an instance with the `create_instance(Device)` method. The `Instance` class starts and stops devices using the `start()` and `stop()` methods, respectively.
