## Chapter 149: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tftp/examples/tftp_test.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tftp/examples/tftp_test.py` is a Python test script used for verifying the functionality of the TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) driver in the JumpStarter project. This test script utilizes the `pytest` framework and imports necessary modules, including the TFTP driver and testing tools from JumpStarter.

   The file contains a class named `TestResource`, which inherits from `JumpstarterTest`. This class serves as a base for all tests related to the TFTP driver. It sets up a specific selector ("board=rpi4") to filter the devices used in the test, and it includes a pytest fixture called `setup_tftp` that initializes and terminates the TFTP client.

   The `test_tftp_operations` method is where the main tests for the TFTP driver take place. It tests two functionalities: uploading a file using the TFTP client and then deleting it. The test uses a simple "test.bin" file containing data, which is created within the test function and used for both operations.

   This code fits into the project as part of ensuring that the TFTP driver works as expected. By writing tests, developers can catch issues early in development, preventing potential problems from reaching production.

   Example use cases for this code include:

   - Verifying that the TFTP client can correctly upload a file to the specified device.
   - Ensuring that the TFTP client can delete a file after it has been uploaded.
   - Testing the overall functionality of the TFTP driver in various scenarios, such as edge cases or unusual network conditions.
