## Chapter 147: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tasmota/jumpstarter_driver_tasmota/driver.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tasmota/jumpstarter_driver_tasmota/driver.py` is a Python script that serves as a custom driver for Tasmota compatible power switches within the JumpStarter project. This driver utilizes MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) to communicate with Tasmota devices.

   The main class in this file is `TasmotaPower`, which extends `PowerInterface` and `Driver`. This dataclass implements methods for controlling Tasmota power switches, such as turning them on, off, reading their state, closing the connection, and resetting the device. The dataclass also initializes an MQTT client to handle communication with the Tasmota device.

   Key functions in this class include:
   - `__post_init__`: Initializes the MQTT client and sets up event callbacks for handling incoming messages from the Tasmota device.
   - `publish(self, state)`: Sends a command to the Tasmota device using the MQTT client. The function waits for the state of the device to match the published state before returning.
   - `on(self)`, `off(self)`, and `read(self)`: Exported methods for turning the device on, off, and reading its current state, respectively. These methods call the `publish()` function with the appropriate command.
   - `close(self)`: Turns off the device and disconnects from the MQTT client.
   - `reset(self)`: Turns off the device and sends a reset command to the Tasmota device.

   The TasmotaPower driver takes several parameters during instantiation, such as the host IP address, port number, transportation protocol (tcp or websockets), and MQTT-related settings like username and password. These parameters are used to configure the MQTT client accordingly.

   This driver fits into the JumpStarter project by providing a way to control Tasmota power switches using standardized API functions. By integrating with other parts of the JumpStarter ecosystem, developers can easily add support for Tasmota devices within their projects. Example use cases include controlling smart bulbs, fans, and outlets that are compatible with Tasmota.
