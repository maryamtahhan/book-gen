## Chapter 180: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-kubernetes/jumpstarter_kubernetes/leases.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-kubernetes/jumpstarter_kubernetes/leases.py` is part of the Jumpstarter project, which aims to provide a simplified interface for managing Kubernetes resources. This specific module defines classes and functions related to the management of Lease objects in the Kubernetes API.

   The file primarily consists of:

1. Defining classes for various data structures within the Lease object:
   - `V1Alpha1LeaseStatus` represents the status of a lease, including its begin time, end time, whether it has ended or not, its exporter, and conditions related to the lease.
   - `V1Alpha1LeaseSelector` defines the selector for selecting leases based on their match labels.
   - `V1Alpha1LeaseSpec` represents the specification of a lease, including its client, duration, and selector.
   - `V1Alpha1Lease` is the primary class that combines the status, spec, metadata, and other necessary information for a Lease object. It includes static methods to create instances from dictionaries.
   - `V1Alpha1LeaseList` represents a list of Lease objects, with methods to create an instance from a dictionary of lists.

2. Defining the `LeasesV1Alpha1Api` class that interacts with the Kubernetes API for leases. It has two main functions:
   - `list_leases()` retrieves a list of all Lease objects in the cluster asynchronously.
   - `get_lease(name)` retrieves a single Lease object from the cluster by name, asynchronously.

In the project, these classes and functions allow developers to easily manage lease resources in their Kubernetes clusters using the Jumpstarter API. For example, they could use `list_leases()` to get all active leases or `get_lease('my-lease')` to retrieve specific lease details.

        participant user as User
        participant api as API (LeasesV1Alpha1Api)
        participant leaseList as Lease List
        participant lease as Lease

        user->>api: list_leases()
        api->>leaseList: calls Kubernetes API
        leaseList-->>api: returns the list of leases
        api-->user: returns the lease list

        user->>api: get_lease(<name>)
        api->>lease: calls Kubernetes API with specified name
        lease-->>api: returns the details of the lease
        api-->user: returns the details of the lease
   ```

This sequence diagram shows how a user interacts with an API (`LeasesV1Alpha1Api`) to list and get leases from Kubernetes. The API interacts with the actual LeaseList and Lease objects by calling the appropriate Kubernetes methods.
