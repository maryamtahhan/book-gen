## Chapter 27: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/exceptions.py

 The `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/exceptions.py` file is a module within the Jumpstarter project that provides customized exception handling for command-line interface (CLI) functions and decorators. It primarily focuses on two aspects:

1. Exception handling in both blocking and asynchronous functions using decorators `handle_exceptions()` and `async_handle_exceptions()`. These decorators catch `JumpstarterException`, a custom exception defined within the project, as well as built-in Python exceptions, such as `click.ClickException`, and handle them by converting their messages to red for better visibility in the CLI environment.

2. Utility functions based on the PEP 785 Reference Implementation for working with groups of exceptions. Specifically, it contains two utility functions: `leaf_exceptions()` and `_combine_tracebacks()`. These functions help flatten exception groups and combine tracebacks for debugging purposes when dealing with groups of exceptions.

Within the Jumpstarter project, this module plays a crucial role in ensuring that exceptions are handled gracefully across various CLI commands, making it easier to identify and fix issues during development and runtime. By using this module, developers can create custom exception classes, handle exceptions in their functions or decorators, and utilize utility functions for debugging purposes when working with groups of exceptions.

Example use cases:

- A developer encounters an unexpected issue while writing a CLI command that throws a `JumpstarterException`. They can either catch the exception directly using `try`...`except` blocks or decorate the function with the provided `handle_exceptions()` or `async_handle_exceptions()` decorators to handle the exception more gracefully.

- A developer needs to debug a group of exceptions within their project. They can utilize the `leaf_exceptions()` and `_combine_tracebacks()` functions to flatten and combine tracebacks for better visibility during the debugging process.

        Note over ExceptionHandlerRed, Function: If exception is JumpstarterException, wrap it in ClickExceptionRed
        Note over ExceptionHandlerRed, Function: If exception is ClickException, re-raise as is
      ExceptionHandlerRed->>CLI: Raised Exception
      CLI->>User: Display Error Message
   ```

   This sequence diagram illustrates how the main functions interact when an exception occurs within a function. The `User` initiates a command through the `CLI`, which in turn calls a specific function. If an exception is raised (either `JumpstarterException` or `ClickException`), it gets handled by the `ExceptionHandlerRed`. If the exception is a `JumpstarterException`, it will be wrapped with a `ClickExceptionRed` before being re-raised to the `CLI`. The `CLI` then displays the error message back to the user. If the exception was already a `ClickException`, it gets re-raised as is.
