## Chapter 90: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-http/jumpstarter_driver_http/driver_test.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-http/jumpstarter_driver_http/driver_test.py` serves as a test suite for the `HttpServer` class in the `jumpstarter-driver-http` package of the Jumpstarter project. The primary purpose of this test file is to ensure that the HttpServer functions correctly and consistently across various scenarios, verifying its behavior under different conditions.

   To achieve this, the test file includes several test functions:

1. `test_http_server`: This test function checks the basic functionality of the HttpServer class. It creates a temporary directory, serves an HTTP server using the `HttpServer`, uploads a file to it, downloads the file and verifies its contents. It also checks that the file is properly deleted after use.

2. `test_http_server_host_config`: This test function verifies that the custom host configuration for the HttpServer works correctly. By passing a custom host during instantiation of the server, it should return the correct host value.

3. `test_http_server_root_directory_creation`: This test checks if the HttpServer creates the specified root directory during initialization. In this case, if a new directory is provided to the server, it will ensure that the directory exists after instantiation.

   The code in this file is important for maintaining the reliability and stability of the `HttpServer` class. By testing various aspects of its functionality, we can catch and resolve any issues before they affect the overall project.

   In summary, the test suite for the HttpServer class ensures that it functions as intended across different scenarios, such as serving files and handling requests correctly. It also verifies that custom configurations, like host and root directory, are processed appropriately.

      participant User as Client
      participant Server as HttpServer

      Note over User: Creates a temporary file and writes test content to it
      Note over Server: Starts serving the http server with the given root directory

      User->>Server: PUT_FILE request (test.txt) with file path
      Server-->>User: Returns the uploaded URL of the file

      Note over User: Retrieves the file content using the returned URL
      User->>Server: GET request for the uploaded URL
      Server-->>User: Returns the test content from the stored file

      Note over User: Checks if the retrieved content matches the original content
      Note over Server: Deletes the file after successful verification

      User->>Server: DELETE request (test.txt)
      Server-->>User: Acknowledges file deletion

      Note over Server: Lists all files in the root directory to check if the file is deleted
      Server-->>User: Returns a list of files without the deleted test.txt file
