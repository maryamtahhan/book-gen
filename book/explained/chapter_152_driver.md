## Chapter 152: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tftp/jumpstarter_driver_tftp/driver.py

 This chapter focuses on the purpose and functionality of the `driver.py` file located in the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tftp` directory of the Jumpstarter project. The primary function of this module is to implement a driver for a read-only TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server as part of the Jumpstarter framework.

   The `driver.py` file defines a custom class, `Tftp`, which inherits from the abstract base class `Driver`. This class represents the TFTP server driver within Jumpstarter. The `Tftp` class has several key attributes such as root directory (`root_dir`), host (`host`), port (`port`), and a reference to the running TFTP server instance (`server`).

   One important function of this module is the `_start_server()` method, which initializes an event loop using `asyncio`, starts the TFTP server instance, and runs the server until it is shut down. The server's state can be controlled through exported methods such as `start()` for starting the server and `stop()` for gracefully shutting it down.

   Additionally, the module defines a custom exception class, `TftpError`, which is used to raise exceptions related to the TFTP server.

   Example use cases of this code within the Jumpstarter project could be setting up a read-only file transfer service for device firmware or configuration files over the network using the TFTP protocol. However, the specifics of how this driver interacts with other components within the Jumpstarter ecosystem will depend on the overall design and architecture of the project in question.
