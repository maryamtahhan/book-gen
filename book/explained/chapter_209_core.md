## Chapter 209: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/client/core.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/client/core.py` file, we have a base class for driver clients called `AsyncDriverClient`. This class is designed to facilitate communication between the client and drivers using gRPC (Google's Remote Procedure Call protocol). The focus of this code is on creating an asynchronous driver client that can handle both regular function calls and streaming calls.

   Here are some key aspects of this file:

   - `AsyncDriverClient` acts as a base class for actual driver clients, combining the functionality of `ExporterServiceStub` and `RouterServiceStub`. These classes are gRPC service implementations for interacting with drivers using their respective services (Exporter and Router).

   - The class includes several important functions like `call_async`, `streamingcall_async`, `stream_async`, and `resource_async`. These functions allow the client to make regular function calls, streaming calls, manage streams, and handle resources respectively.

   - Some of these functions may raise exceptions such as `DriverError`, `DriverMethodNotImplemented`, or `DriverInvalidArgument`. These exceptions are custom error classes that handle errors that may occur during communication with drivers.

   - The `AsyncDriverClient` also handles logging using a built-in logger, allowing users to set the desired log level. A simple example use case would be to create an instance of the `AsyncDriverClient`, call a driver function asynchronously using the `call_async` method, and handle any potential errors that may arise.

   In summary, this code defines a base class for creating asynchronous driver clients, which allow users to interact with drivers using gRPC calls while handling logging and error cases.
