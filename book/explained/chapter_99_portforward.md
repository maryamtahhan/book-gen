## Chapter 99: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/portforward.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/portforward.py` is a component of the Jumpstarter project, providing a mechanism for port forwarding using both TCP and Unix domain sockets. This functionality enables remote connections to be made to local resources by directing traffic through a central driver.

   The file defines two main classes: `TcpPortforwardAdapter` and `UnixPortforwardAdapter`. These adapters allow users to establish a connection with the Jumpstarter driver using either TCP or Unix domain sockets, respectively. They are both implemented as asynchronous context managers, enabling their usage in an easy-to-understand and efficient manner.

   The `handler` function is responsible for forwarding incoming data from the network to the driver's stream, providing a bidirectional connection between the remote client and the driver. This function is used by both the TCP and Unix domain socket adapters.

   The portforward adapters fit into the Jumpstarter project by offering an additional means of connecting to the driver, expanding its networking capabilities for clients that require specific network configurations (e.g., TCP or Unix domain sockets). This feature is particularly useful in distributed systems and applications where multiple nodes need to communicate with the central driver.

   Example use cases:

   - A user wishes to create a TCP connection from a remote client to the Jumpstarter driver using a specific local port (e.g., `local_port=8080`). They would do this by creating an instance of the `TcpPortforwardAdapter`, specifying their desired settings, and using it as a context manager in their code:

     ```python
     with TcpPortforwardAdapter(client, method="connect", local_port=8080) as addr:
         # Use the address (addr) to establish a connection with the driver from your remote client
     ```

   - Similarly, if a user wants to create a Unix domain socket connection to the Jumpstarter driver using a specific path (e.g., `path="/tmp/my_socket"`), they would use the following code:

     ```python
     with UnixPortforwardAdapter(client, method="connect", path="/tmp/my_socket") as addr:
         # Use the address (addr) to establish a connection with the driver from your remote client
     ```

DriverClient->>Adapter: Initiate TcpPortforwardAdapter or UnixPortforwardAdapter
Adapter->>Connection: Start listener on local host and port
DriverClient->>Stream: Create stream for specified method
Stream-->>Stream: Data to be forwarded
Adapter->>Connection: Establish connection with remote peer
Stream-->>Connection: Forward data from Stream
Connection-->>Connection: Data received from remote peer
Adapter->>Stream: Forward data from Connection

Note over DriverClient, Adapter: Both TCP and Unix adapters follow the same process for handling data forwarding
```
This diagram represents the main interaction between the `DriverClient`, `Adapter` (either TCP or Unix), and `Stream` when using the portforwarding functionality. The `Connection` is also included to show how it connects with the remote peer and forwards data bi-directionally.
