## Chapter 89: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-http/jumpstarter_driver_http/driver.py

 The `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-http/jumpstarter_driver_http/driver.py` file defines the core functionality of an HTTP Server driver for Jumpstarter, a project-specific toolkit or framework. This driver allows you to create and manage an HTTP server within the Jumpstarter ecosystem.

   The main class, `HttpServer`, extends the `Driver` base class from the Jumpstarter library. It manages an HTTP server using the popular `aiohttp` library and provides methods for starting, stopping, and interacting with the server. The properties in this class include root directory, host, port, timeout, and an Aiohttp application instance.

   Some important functions of this file are:

   - `start()`: Starts the HTTP server and raises an `HttpServerError` exception if it fails to start.
   - `stop()`: Stops the HTTP server and raises an `HttpServerError` exception if it fails to stop.
   - `get_url()`, `get_host()`, and `get_port()`: Retrieve the base URL, host IP address, and port number of the running HTTP server respectively.

   The class also defines a helper method `close()` for cleaning up resources when the driver is no longer needed. This function ensures that both synchronous and asynchronous cleanup tasks are handled properly.

   In terms of project fit, this code provides an essential part of Jumpstarter by enabling HTTP server functionality. Developers can utilize this driver to serve static files or build web applications within their projects more easily.

   For example, you might use the HttpServer driver to serve static content for a simple website in your Jumpstarter project:

   ```python
   from jumpstarter_driver_http.HttpServer import HttpServer

   http_server = HttpServer(root_dir="/path/to/my/static")
   await http_server.start()

   # Your code here, utilizing the served static files...

   await http_server.stop()
   ```
