## Chapter 95: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/fabric_test.py

 In the given code, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/fabric_test.py` serves as a test script for integrating Paramiko (SSH library) with the FabricAdapter class within the Jumpstarter project. This file sets up an SSH server and connects to it using the `FabricAdapter` class, simulating a communication between a client and a fabric network device using SSH protocol.

   The `SSHServer` class inherits from the `paramiko.ServerInterface`, which defines methods for handling authentication, channel requests (including exec requests), and other server-side interactions required by Paramiko to manage an SSH session. In this case, the `check_auth_password`, `check_channel_request`, and `check_channel_exec_request` methods are overridden with dummy implementations that send back a successful response.

   The `SSHHandler` class is responsible for setting up an SSH session using the provided transport and creating a new SSHServer instance. It also handles the main loop of the server, where it sleeps for 1 second between each iteration to keep the connection alive.

   In the function `test_client_adapter_fabric()`, an SSH server is created and started in a separate thread using the provided TCPServer and SSHHandler classes. A TcpNetwork client is then established, connected to the newly created SSH server via its IP address and port, and uses the FabricAdapter class for communication with the device. The function also demonstrates how to authenticate to the fabric device by providing a password in the `connect_kwargs` parameter of the FabricAdapter instance.

   Finally, the script sends a "dummy command" using the connected FabricAdapter and closes the connection before shutting down the SSH server. This code allows developers working on Jumpstarter to easily test the integration between their networking driver and the fabric network devices using SSH communication. It provides an example use case for testing purposes by executing a simple command on the fabric device.

   This file fits in the project as part of the testing infrastructure, ensuring that the FabricAdapter class works as intended with different scenarios and edge cases when interacting with fabric devices over SSH connections.
