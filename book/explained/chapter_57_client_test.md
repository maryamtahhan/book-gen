## Chapter 57: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-can/jumpstarter_driver_can/client_test.py

 This chapter discusses the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-can/jumpstarter_driver_can/client_test.py` file, which is a test module for the CAN (Controller Area Network) driver in the Jumpstarter project. The purpose of this file is to verify the functionality and correctness of the CAN client classes within the driver.

   The test module imports necessary packages such as `can`, `isotp`, `pytest`, and includes functions from other modules like `jumpstarter_driver_can/common/utils`. It contains several test cases that focus on various aspects of the CAN client, including sending and receiving messages, properties, iterators, filters, notifiers, redirects, periodic messaging, ISOTP support, and ISOTP socket support.

   The test functions utilize the `pytest` framework to organize and run tests. Each test case is designed to cover a specific functionality of the CAN client, such as:

   - `test_client_can_send_recv`: Verifies that the client can send and receive messages on a virtual bus.
   - `test_client_can_property`: Checks that the properties of the CAN client (channel info, state, and protocol) match those of the underlying driver's bus.
   - `test_client_can_iterator`: Ensures that the client can iterate through messages received on a virtual bus.
   - `test_client_can_filter`: Verifies that the client can filter incoming CAN messages based on arbitration ID, extended frame format, and mask bits.
   - `test_client_can_notifier`: Tests the functionality of the CAN notifier, which allows registering callbacks for specific message types or from specific sources.
   - `test_client_can_redirect`: Checks that messages can be redirected to other buses using the CAN notifier's redirect reader function.
   - `test_client_can_send_periodic_local` and `test_client_can_send_periodic_remote`: Test the periodic sending of messages on a local or remote bus, respectively.
   - `test_client_can_isotp` and `test_client_isotp`: Test the ISOTP (CAN over TTP/TPC) support, both in non-blocking and blocking modes, as well as with different address configurations.

   These tests help ensure that the CAN driver's client functions work correctly under various scenarios and conditions, ultimately improving the overall reliability and robustness of the Jumpstarter project.

                    assert Can2.recv().data == "hello"
            end

        Test_CanProperty:
            Given CAN driver with virtual bus
            assert Can.channel_info == Bus.channel_info
            assert Can.state == Bus.state

        Test_CanIterator:
            Given CAN driver with virtual bus
            When Can1 sends multiple messages
            Then the iterator over CAN2 returns the sent messages in order

        Test_CanFilter:
            Given CAN drivers with virtual bus and filter set on CAN2
            When CAN1 sends messages to bus
                assert CAN2 receives only the filtered message(s)

        Test_CanNotifier:
            Given CAN driver with virtual bus and notifier setup on CAN2
            When Can1 sends a message
                assert listener is called with the sent message

        Test_CanRedirect:
            Given CAN drivers with virtual bus and redirect setup on CAN2
            When Can1 sends a message to bus
                assert inner bus receives the message

        Test_CanSendPeriodic_Local:
            Given CAN driver with virtual bus and periodically sending messages from Can1
            When the periodic task is running for specified duration
                assert CAN2 receives the sent messages in order

        Test_CanSendPeriodic_Remote:
            Given CAN driver with virtual bus and periodically sending messages from Can1 (autostart=False)
            When the periodic task is started manually on Can1
                assert CAN2 receives the sent messages in order

        Test_ClientCanIsotp:

            When a message is sent from one client
                assert the other client receives the same message

        Test_ClientIsotpAddresses:

            When a message is sent between clients with asymmetric addresses
                assert the message is received correctly by both clients

        Test_ClientIsotpSocket:
            Given CAN drivers with vcan0 interface and ISOTP setup on both clients
            When a message is sent from one client
                assert the other client receives the same message
