## Chapter 167: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-yepkit/jumpstarter_driver_yepkit/conftest.py

 The `conftest.py` file located in the path `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-yepkit/jumpstarter_driver_yepkit` is a custom configuration file used within the testing infrastructure of the Jumpstarter project, specifically for the Yepkit driver package.

   The primary purpose of this file is to define hooks that will be called automatically by the pytest framework before and after individual test functions are run. These hooks can be used to set up shared resources, tear them down, skip tests under certain conditions, or perform any other necessary actions.

   In this particular implementation, there are three custom functions defined: `pytest_runtest_call`, `yepkit_device_exists`, and `get_yepkit_device`.

   - The `pytest_runtest_call` function is a pytest hook that gets executed before each test function. It attempts to run the test function by calling `item.runtest()`. If any of the following errors occur (FileNotFoundError, usb.core.USBError, or usb.core.NoBackendError), the test will be skipped with an appropriate message. This helps ensure that tests do not fail due to missing dependencies or unavailable hardware resources.

   - The `yepkit_device_exists` function checks whether a Yepkit device is currently connected and available for use. It does this by scanning the USB bus for devices with a VID (Vendor ID) and PID (Product ID) matching those of the Yepkit device. If a device is found, it returns the corresponding `usb.Device` object; otherwise, it raises a FileNotFoundError exception.

   - The `get_yepkit_device` function is a decorator that can be applied to test functions to automatically call `yepkit_device_exists()` before running the test and provide the found device to the test function as an argument if one is available. If no device is found, the test will skip as usual.

   In the broader context of the project, this code ensures that tests related to the Yepkit driver are only executed when a Yepkit device is present and accessible. This helps maintain test stability and reduces the chances of false positives or negatives due to missing or unavailable hardware resources.

   Example use case: Consider a test function that verifies the correctness of data communication with the Yepkit device. With `get_yepkit_device` applied as a decorator, the test will automatically check for the presence of a Yepkit device before running and will receive the device object if one is found. If no device is available, the test will be skipped, preventing unnecessary errors and making it easier to identify issues specifically related to the driver code.
