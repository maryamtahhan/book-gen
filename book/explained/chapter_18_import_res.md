## Chapter 18: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/import_res.py

 This chapter discusses the purpose and functionality of the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/import_res.py` in a technical book based on the JumpStarter project.

   The primary role of this Python script is to enable the importation of Kubernetes cluster configuration objects, specifically client and exporter configurations, into the local project's configuration files. This process can be useful for managing multiple clusters or environments within the JumpStarter framework.

   The `import_res` module consists of two main components: the `import_client()` and `import_exporter()` functions. These functions are grouped together under a `@click.group("import")` decorator, which denotes them as a command group in the JumpStarter CLI.

   The `import_client(...)` function allows users to import client configurations from a Kubernetes cluster. It takes various options such as the desired name for the client configuration, namespaces, kubeconfig file paths, contexts, TLS settings, and output paths. Users can also specify which driver packages to load by using the `--allow` option, or they can choose to allow all driver packages with the `--unsafe` flag (although this is not recommended).

   The `import_exporter(...)` function serves a similar purpose but is intended for importing exporter configurations. It works similarly to the `import_client()` function, allowing users to specify an output path for the imported configuration and providing various options for connecting to the Kubernetes cluster.

   These functions utilize several helper functions and classes defined in other modules within the same package (e.g., `handle_k8s_api_exception`, `handle_k8s_config_exception`, etc.). They also interact with external APIs provided by the Kubernetes SDK (`ClientsV1Alpha1Api` and `ExportersV1Alpha1Api`) to fetch the configuration objects from the cluster.

   Example use cases for these functions might involve:

   - Importing a specific client configuration (e.g., `jumpstarter import client my-client --kubeconfig /path/to/my-kubeconfig.yaml`).
   - Importing an exporter configuration with a custom output file path (e.g., `jumpstarter import exporter my-exporter --out /path/to/my-exporter-config.yaml`).
