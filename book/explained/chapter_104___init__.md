 Chapter Title: Understanding `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/streams/__init__.py` in the JumpStarter Project

In the JumpStarter project, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/streams/__init__.py` serves as a central module for managing various stream-related functionalities, specifically websocket streams in this instance.

The primary function of this file is to import and make available the `WebsocketServerStream` class, which provides a means for bidirectional communication between two endpoints over a websocket connection. By utilizing this class, developers can establish real-time, interactive communication channels within the JumpStarter system.

The `WebsocketServerStream` is an essential component of the project's networking infrastructure. This class manages the establishment and management of websocket connections, handling incoming messages, and propagating them to registered callback functions for processing.

Here is a brief overview of the `WebsocketServerStream` class:

- **Class Name**: WebsocketServerStream
  - **Purpose**: Establishes a bi-directional communication channel using WebSockets.
  - **Methods and Attributes** (some notables are highlighted here):
    + initialize(): Initializes the websocket stream, sets up event handlers, and starts the underlying WebSocket server.
      ```python
      def __init__(self, handler: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None], *args, **kwargs) -> None:
          # initialize the WebSocketServerStream
      ```
    + send_message(data: Dict[str, Any]): Sends a message to the connected client through the underlying websocket connection.
      ```python
      async def send_message(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
          # send a message to the connected client
      ```
    + stop(): Gracefully closes the underlying WebSocket connection and unregisters the stream from its respective manager.
      ```python
      async def stop(self) -> None:
          # gracefully close the WebSocket connection and unregister the stream
      ```

This code is an integral part of the JumpStarter project, enabling real-time interaction between different components and services within the system. For example, a user interface (UI) could use the `WebsocketServerStream` to communicate with a backend service in real-time, allowing for responsive and interactive experiences. Similarly, various services can exchange data and synchronize their behavior through these websocket streams, enhancing the overall functionality and cohesion of the JumpStarter system.
