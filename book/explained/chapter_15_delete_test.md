## Chapter 15: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/delete_test.py

 The `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/delete_test.py` file is a test script for the delete command in the JumpStarter CLI Admin utility. This utility provides administrative functions for managing Kubernetes resources such as clients and exporters. The `delete_test.py` file specifically tests the behavior of the `delete` command for both client and exporter objects.

   The test script is designed to cover various use cases:

   1. Deleting a non-existent client or exporter, where the corresponding configuration does not exist.
   2. Deleting an existing client or exporter with interactive and non-interactive prompts for confirmation.
   3. Deleting an existing client or exporter that is either current or not current, as determined by the user configuration.

   The script uses unittest.mock to simulate the behavior of various functions and classes:

   - `ClientConfigV1Alpha1.delete()`, `ClientConfigV1Alpha1.exists()`, `ClientsV1Alpha1Api.delete_client()`: These are related to managing client objects in Kubernetes.
   - `ExporterConfigV1Alpha1.delete()`, `ExporterConfigV1Alpha1.exists()`, `ExportersV1Alpha1Api.delete_exporter()`: These are related to managing exporter objects in Kubernetes.
   - `UserConfigV1Alpha1.load_or_create()` and `UserConfigV1Alpha1.save()`: These methods are used for loading or creating user configurations in the system.
   - `ClientsV1Alpha1Api._load_kube_config()`: This method is responsible for loading the kubeconfig file for communicating with the Kubernetes API server.

   In the context of the JumpStarter project, the `delete_test.py` script verifies that the `delete` command functions as intended when interacting with clients and exporters in a Kubernetes cluster. The test cases ensure correct behavior for both interactive and non-interactive modes, as well as handling situations where the object or its configuration does not exist.

       User-->>CLI: Inputs Y or n (or skips input if --nointeractive)
       CLI->>ClientConfig/ExporterConfig: Deletes the object from KubeAPI (if config exists and user chooses yes or if not interactive)
       ClientConfig/ExporterConfig-->>KubeAPI: Sends delete request
       KubeAPI-->>ClientConfig/ExporterConfig: Confirms delete
       ClientConfig/ExporterConfig->>User: Notifies user of success or failure (if config exists and user chooses yes)
