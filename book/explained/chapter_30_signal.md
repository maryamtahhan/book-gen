## Chapter 30: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/signal.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/signal.py` is a module for handling asynchronous signal processing within the Jumpstarter command-line interface (CLI). This module, using the `anyio` library, allows the CLI to gracefully terminate when receiving certain signals such as SIGINT and SIGTERM.

   The most important function in this file is `signal_handler()`. This function is an asynchronous coroutine that listens for specific signals defined by constants `signal.SIGINT` and `signal.SIGTERM`. When one of these signals is received, it outputs a message to the user and cancels the current operation using the provided `CancelScope`.

   The purpose of this code is to ensure that the CLI behaves appropriately when it receives certain interrupt signals, like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM (kill command). By doing so, the application will shut down cleanly and properly handle any resources or tasks that are currently running.

   In the context of the larger project, this module helps in making the CLI more user-friendly and robust by allowing it to respond gracefully to user interruptions. This is particularly important for long-running commands or background processes.

   Example use cases might involve using a command in the Jumpstarter CLI that takes several minutes to complete, and the user decides to cancel the operation before its completion. By integrating this signal handler, the CLI can terminate the running task gracefully without causing any issues or errors.

      Participant User as User
      Participant App as App
      Participant SignalHandler as SignalHandler

      User->>App: SIGINT/SIGTERM
      App->>SignalHandler: Receive signal
      SignalHandler->>App: Check signal type
      SignalHandler->>User: Print message and cancel operation (if applicable)
   ```

This mermaid diagram illustrates the interaction between the user, the app, and the `signal_handler` function. The user sends a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal to the app, which then forwards it to the `signal_handler`. The `signal_handler` checks the type of the received signal, prints an appropriate message, and if applicable, cancels the operation.
