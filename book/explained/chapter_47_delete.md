## Chapter 47: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/delete.py

 This chapter will explain the purpose and functionality of the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/delete.py` in a technical book based on the JumpStarter project.

   **Overview**

   The primary function of this Python script is to provide command-line interface (CLI) for deleting resources, specifically leases, within the JumpStarter ecosystem. It's part of the `jumpstarter-cli` package and is used to manage resources through the CLI.

   **Important Functions**

   - The main function `delete()` defines a group of commands for deleting resources. This function does not execute any action but serves as a container for other delete commands.

   - The function `delete_leases(config, name: str, selector: str | None, all: bool, output: OutputType)` is the core functionality of the file. It takes in configuration data (`config`) and various options to filter leases and perform deletion operations.

   **Where this code fits in the project**

   The `delete_leases()` function is part of a larger package that offers CLI utilities for managing JumpStarter resources. In this case, it handles lease resource deletions. Users can interact with the system by invoking commands from the command line.

   **Example use cases**

   To delete an existing lease named "my_lease", run the following command:

      jumpstarter leases delete my_lease

   If you want to delete all leases associated with a specific client, first find the client's name using `jumpstarter leases list`, then execute:

      jumpstarter leases delete --all [client_name]

   Users can also filter leases by selector and specify the desired output format (e.g., only printing lease names or a detailed message):

      jumpstarter leases delete --selector "environment=prod" --output name

   The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/delete.py` plays an essential role in facilitating efficient and flexible resource management within the JumpStarter project, making it easier for developers to work with the system and manage their resources effectively.
