## Chapter 96: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/novnc.py

 In the `jumpstarter` project, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/novnc.py` is a Python module that provides an adapter for the NoVNC (HTML5 VNC client) in the broader context of the Driver Network communication layer. This adapter enables users to interact with a remote Virtual Machine (VM) using the NoVNC protocol via a web-based VNC client.

   The central class in this file is `NovncAdapter`. This decorator function, which combines both synchronous and asynchronous context manager behaviors, is responsible for managing the interaction between the driver client and the NoVNC server. It takes two arguments: `client` (an instance of `DriverClient`) representing the connection to the remote VM, and an optional `method` parameter with a default value of "connect". This method parameter determines the type of operation that will be performed.

   The `handler()` function is defined asynchronously, which will handle incoming connections from the NoVNC client. It accepts one argument, `conn`, representing the connection socket from the client. Inside this function, an asynchronous context manager is used to establish a stream between the remote driver and the local NoVNC server using the `client.stream_async(method)` function. The `WebsocketServerStream()` function is then utilized to create a WebSocket stream over the established connection.

   With the help of the `forward_stream()` decorator, the data received from the NoVNC client via the local socket (`conn`) will be forwarded to the remote driver's stream and vice versa. This ensures that any changes made in the remote VM through the NoVNC client are immediately reflected locally.

   The `TemporaryTcpListener()` function is used to create a temporary TCP listener for incoming connections from the NoVNC client. Using this listener, an address (IP and port) pair will be yielded to another part of the program that can then construct the URL needed to connect to the NoVNC server. The URL is constructed with the help of the `urlunparse()` function, which encodes the autoconnect parameter, reconnect parameter, host, and port in the URL query parameters.

   An example use case for this module could be:

   ```python
   from jumpstarter_driver_network.adapters import novnc
   ...
   async def start_vm():
       driver = await get_driver_connection()  # Somehow obtain a connection to the remote VM
       novnc_addr = yield novnc.NovncAdapter(client=driver)  # Start the NoVNC server for the VM
       novnc_url = f"https://{novc_addr[0]}:{novc_addr[1]}/noVNC/vnc.html"
       print("Open the following URL in a web browser to connect to the VM: ", novnc_url)
   ```

   In this example, `start_vm()` is an asynchronous function that establishes a connection to a remote VM using the driver and then starts the NoVNC server for the VM. The URL required to connect to the NoVNC server will be yielded by the `NovncAdapter` decorator, allowing users to easily access their VMs through the NoVNC client.

This mermaid sequence diagram illustrates how the key functions interact in the `NovncAdapter` of the `jumpstarter-driver-network` package. The driver client initiates a connection, which is handled by the NovncAdapter. The adapter creates a temporary TCP listener to establish a connection with the VNC client. The WebsocketServerStream is used to forward the data between the VNC client and the TCP connection.
