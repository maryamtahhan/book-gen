## Chapter 31: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/table.py

 In the `jumpstarter` project, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/table.py` serves as a utility module for generating and printing pretty tables from provided data. The main purpose of this module is to enhance the readability and organization of data that is displayed in the Command Line Interface (CLI) components of the project.

   The central function in this module is `make_table(columns: list[str], values: list[dict])`. This function takes a list of column names as its first argument and a list of dictionaries representing rows for each column as its second argument. It then creates a Rich Table object with the specified columns and populates it with the provided data. The `Rich.Table` class is imported from the `rich` library, which provides an easy way to format and print tables in the console.

   The table can be customized by modifying the style of individual columns, padding around the edges, and other options. In this case, the table's box and header styles are set to None, and padding around the edge is disabled. If a column name is "UUID", the `no_wrap` option is enabled to ensure that the UUID value is not wrapped to the next line if it exceeds the width of the console.

   When the table is fully populated, it is printed using a `Rich.Console` object and saved as a string in a `StringIO` buffer for later use if needed. If you're unfamiliar with these libraries or classes, `StringIO` is an I/O stream buffer that can be used to save strings as if they were files, while `console` from the `rich` library provides console output formatting and styling capabilities.

   This code fits within the project by providing a consistent way to display data in the CLI components, ensuring that output is clean, easy-to-read, and well-organized. Example use cases for this code could include generating tables of project tasks, logs, or system information. For instance, in a task management application, you might call `make_table(columns=['Task ID', 'Description', 'Assigned To'], values=[{'id': '123', 'description': 'Fix bug', 'assigned to': 'John'}, {'id': '456', 'description': 'Add feature', 'assigned to': 'Jane'}])` to display the tasks assigned to users.

      note over CL: Returns the formatted table as a string
