## Chapter 34: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/version.py

 In the Jumpstarter project, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/version.py` serves as a utility module for handling version information related to the Jumpstarter Python client and CLI (Command Line Interface) binary.

   The main functions in this file include:

1. `get_client_version()`: Retrieves the version of the Jumpstarter Python client/exporter, using the built-in `importlib.metadata` module.
2. `get_cli_path()`: Returns the path of the current Jumpstarter CLI binary by navigating up two directories from the location of the currently executing file (`__file__`).
3. `version_msg()`: Generates a human-readable version message for Jumpstarter, incorporating the client version, its path, and the Python version running the CLI.
4. `JumpstarterVersion` is a class that represents Jumpstarter's version information as an object. It utilizes Pydantic to store the git_version (the version of the Jumpstarter package) and python_version (Python version the CLI is running on). The class also has methods for serializing its data in JSON and YAML formats using built-in Python libraries.
5. `version_obj()`: Creates an instance of the `JumpstarterVersion` class, using the returned values from the `get_client_version()` and `sys.version` functions.
6. The `version()` function (decorated with `@click.command()`) is a command-line utility that can be used to retrieve the current Jumpstarter version. It takes an optional argument for the output format, and it outputs the version information in JSON, YAML, or a human-readable format depending on the provided output format.

   In summary, this module provides the necessary infrastructure for handling versioning details of the Jumpstarter Python client/exporter and CLI. It also allows for users to easily obtain version information through the command line interface.

      User->>CLI: Run version command
      CLI-->VersionFunc: Call get_client_version()
      VersionFunc-->>CLI: Returns jumpstarter version (e.g., "1.0.0")
      CLI-->VersionObj: Create VersionObject instance with version data and python version
      CLI-->OutputFunc: Get output mode from command line arguments
      OutputFunc-->>CLI: OutputFunction returns the appropriate output method (JSON, YAML or console)
      CLI-->VersionObj: VersionObject calls dump_json() for JSON or dump_yaml() for YAML format
      VersionObj-->>CLI: Returns version data in desired format
      CLI-->User: Display the version information to the user
