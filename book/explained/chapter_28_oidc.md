## Chapter 28: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/oidc.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/oidc.py` is a module that provides OIDC (OpenID Connect) functionality for the Jumpstarter CLI (Command Line Interface). This functionality includes client configuration, token handling, and various OIDC grant types (password, authorization code, etc.).

   The main class in this file is `Config`, which holds the OIDC issuer, client ID, and scope. It provides methods to retrieve the OpenID Connect configuration, create an OAuth2Session instance for the client, and handle different token exchange grant types.

   - `configuration()`: Retrieves the OpenID Connect configuration from the issuer's well-known endpoint.
   - `client(**kwargs)`: Creates an OAuth2Session instance with the specified client ID and scope.
   - `token_exchange_grant(self, token: str, **kwargs)`: Exchanges a given access token for a new access token using the token exchange grant type.
   - `password_grant(self, username: str, password: str)`: Performs a password grant to obtain an access token.
   - `authorization_code_grant()`: Initiates and handles an authorization code grant flow, including starting a local web server for the callback, creating an authorization URL, and exchanging the authorization code for an access token.

   The `opt_oidc(f)` decorator allows you to pass OIDC-related options when defining click commands, making it easier to handle authentication within the CLI. The provided functions `decode_jwt(token: str)` and `decode_jwt_issuer(token: str)` help with parsing and extracting information from JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens.

   This code is a part of the overall project, where it enables secure authentication for users when interacting with the CLI. The OIDC functionality allows you to authenticate using different grant types, making it more flexible and adaptable to various deployment scenarios. For example, you can use the password grant type for local development or an authorization code grant in a multi-tenant environment with multiple identities.

    Note over C: User provides credentials or token

    Note over C: User chooses authentication method (password, authorization code, etc.)

    C->>+S: Authenticate using chosen method

    Note over C, TS: If token, store it and return it to client. Otherwise proceed with token exchange.

    TS-->>C: Stored token

    Note over C: If token, user can continue interaction. If not, continue with token exchange.

    C->>+TS: Retrieve stored token (if applicable)
    C-->>-TS: Return token if found

    C->>+S: Token exchange if required
    C-->>-S: New access_token

    Note over C, S: User can now interact with protected resources.

    C->>S: Call protected API (using access_token)
    S-->>C: Response from protected API
