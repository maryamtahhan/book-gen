## Chapter 252: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/streams/progress.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/streams/progress.py` is a module in the Jumpstarter project, which provides a custom progress stream for tracking data transfers with a progress bar. The main purpose of this module is to enhance the user experience by providing real-time feedback on the status of large data transfers.

   This file contains two primary components:

   1. `logging_tqdm` class, which extends the built-in `tqdm` progress bar from the `tqdm` library to log progress messages directly into Python's logging system instead of printing them to the console.

   2. `ProgressStream` dataclass, an implementation of the `ObjectStream` interface provided by the `anyio` library. This class encapsulates a data stream and adds progress tracking functionality to it using the `logging_tqdm` class for logging or displaying the progress bar on the console.

   The `ProgressStream` class is designed to be used in conjunction with other data streams within the Jumpstarter project, allowing users to monitor the transfer of large amounts of data with real-time feedback. To create a new `ProgressStream`, you can simply instantiate the class and pass an existing data stream along with an optional `logging` flag:

   ```python
   import logging
   from jumpstarter.packages.jumpstarter.jumpstarter.streams.progress import ProgressStream

   # Configure your logger as needed
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

   my_data_stream = ...  # some ObjectStream instance, e.g., created by another module in the project

   progress_stream = ProgressStream(my_data_stream, logging=True)
   ```

   In this example, `ProgressStream` will display the progress bar and log each update using the configured logger. If you do not want to log the progress, simply set `logging=False`.

   By integrating the `ProgressStream`, users can easily track large data transfers within the Jumpstarter project with a minimal amount of code. This helps improve the overall user experience by providing real-time feedback on the status of long-running operations.

       User->>ProgressStream: send data (bytes)
       ProgressStream->>Stream: Forward data
       Note over ProgressStream, Stream: ProgressStream tracks data transfer with tqdm
       Stream-->>User: Receive data
   ```

This diagram represents a sequence where the user sends data to the `ProgressStream`, which forwards the data to the underlying `Stream`. The `ProgressStream` keeps track of the data transfer using the tqdm progress bar. When the user receives data, it comes from the `Stream`.
