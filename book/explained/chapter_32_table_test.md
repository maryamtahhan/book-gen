## Chapter 32: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/table_test.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/table_test.py` file of the project, a custom table generation function called `make_table()` is defined and tested. This function takes two arguments: `COLUMNS`, a list of strings representing column headers, and `DATA`, a list or iterable of dictionaries where each dictionary maps column header strings to their corresponding cell values.

   The purpose of the `make_table()` function is to format the data in a tabular structure with properly aligned columns and row separators. This provides an easy-to-read output for displaying test results or other structured data.

   In this file, there is also a predefined expected table (EXPECTED_TABLE) used as a reference for testing the correctness of the `make_table()` function. The expected table contains a simple tabular structure with two columns and one row of data.

   This code fits into the larger project by providing a utility for generating clean and well-formatted tables, which can be used throughout the command-line interface (CLI) modules to present test results or other structured data in an easily digestible format.

   As an example use case, imagine that you have a testing function that generates a list of dictionaries containing test results for various tests within your CLI application. Instead of manually formatting the output, you can pass this list of dictionaries to the `make_table()` function and receive a properly formatted table as the output:

   ```python
   from jumpstarter_cli_common.table import make_table

   tests = [
       {"Test Name": "Test 1", "Result": "Pass"},
       {"Test Name": "Test 2", "Result": "Fail"}
   ]
   table = make_table(["Test Name", "Result"], tests)
   print(table)

   # Output:
   # Test Name        Result
   # Test 1          Pass
   # Test 2          Fail
   ```
