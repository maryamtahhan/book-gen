 Title: Understanding the `Console` Class in the `jumpstarter-driver-pyserial` Package

   The file `Console.py`, located within the `jumpstarter_driver_pyserial` directory of the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-pyserial` project, is responsible for creating a console interface that communicates with a connected device via the serial port. This class facilitates interactive, real-time communication between the user and the hardware using the Python Serial library in conjunction with the AnyIO library to handle asynchronous input and output streams.

   The primary function of this file is to create an instance of the `Console` class, which establishes a connection to the connected device via its associated serial client (a `DriverClient` object). Once the connection is established, the console runs an infinite loop that reads data from the user's terminal and sends it to the connected device, as well as displaying incoming data from the device on the terminal.

   Important Functions and Classes:

   - `ConsoleExit`: A custom exception raised when the user decides to exit the console by typing a specific sequence of keys (Ctrl-B three times). This enables a graceful shutdown of the console without any errors or exceptions.
   - `Console`: The main class defining the behavior of the console interface. It takes a serial client as an argument and has methods for establishing the connection, reading from stdin, writing to the connected device, and handling the console's termination.
   - Various asynchronous methods (`__run`, `__serial_to_stdout`, `__stdin_to_serial`) are used in conjunction with the AnyIO library to handle the asynchronous nature of serial communication.

   This code fits into the project as part of the user interface layer, allowing users to interact directly with the connected device over a serial connection. The console provides a simple, convenient way to execute commands, observe their output, and monitor the state of the connected hardware in real-time.

   Example Use Cases:
   - Developers can use the console to test and debug their device drivers quickly and efficiently by interacting with the connected hardware directly from the command line.
   - End-users can leverage the console for troubleshooting, fine-tuning device configurations, or performing various tasks that require real-time feedback from the connected device.

      participant User as User
      participant Console as Console
      participant SerialClient as SerialClient

      User->>Console: Input data (type, press enter)
      Console->>SerialClient: Send data via serial stream
      SerialClient->>Serial Driver: Send data to the connected device

      Serial Driver-->>SerialClient: Receive data from connected device
      SerialClient-->>Console: Forward data to console output
      Note over Console,SerialClient: Asynchronous communication using AnyIO streams

      User->>Console: Press Ctrl-B three times (type "^C")
      Console->>SerialClient: Send EOF signal
      SerialClient->>Serial Driver: Disconnect from the connected device
   ```

This Mermaid sequence diagram illustrates how user input is received by the console, forwarded to the `SerialClient` object, and sent to the connected device through a serial connection. The diagram also shows the asynchronous nature of the communication using AnyIO streams and demonstrates how the console can handle an EOF signal (Ctrl-B three times) to gracefully shut down the connection with the connected device.
