## Chapter 154: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-tftp/jumpstarter_driver_tftp/server.py

 This code is a part of a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server implementation in Python using the asyncio library for asynchronous operations.

   The provided snippet defines two classes: `TftpReadTransfer` and `TftpTransferProtocol`. The `TftpReadTransfer` class represents a TFTP transfer, handling the data transmission to the client. It creates the packets to be sent and takes care of retransmitting lost or incorrectly received ACKs (Acknowledgment packets).

   The `TftpTransferProtocol` class is responsible for handling incoming datagrams from the client, verifying their validity, and forwarding them to the corresponding `TftpReadTransfer`.

   In this snippet, you can see the main functions used in both classes. Here's a brief summary of each:

1. `_create_oack_packet`: Creates an OACK (Option ACK) packet that includes the negotiated options for the transfer.
2. `_create_data_packet`: Creates a DATA packet containing the actual data to be sent and its block number.
3. `handle_ack`: Handles incoming ACK packets, updating the state of the transfer accordingly.
4. `datagram_received`: Receives incoming datagrams from the client and checks if they are valid. Forwards them to the corresponding `TftpReadTransfer`.
5. `connection_made`, `connection_lost`, and other methods related to handling connections (establishing, losing, errors).

   Note that this snippet only provides the basic functionality for a TFTP server. To create a complete TFTP server, you'll need additional components like file opening/closing, error handling, etc.

 This code defines a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server in Python using the `asyncio` library. The server allows clients to download files by sending a request for a specific file and handling the transfer of that file.

Here's an overview of the classes and functions defined:

- `TftpServerHandler` is responsible for handling incoming requests from clients, managing file transfers, and sending error responses when necessary.

- `TftpRequestHandler` is a subclass of `TftpServerHandler`, which is used to handle MODE LIST (request for available modes) and TYPE requests (specify the type of data transfer).

- The main server is implemented in `TFTPD`. It creates an `asyncio` server socket, sets up event loops, and manages connections by creating instances of `TftpRequestHandler` or `TftpServerHandler` based on the received request.

The code also includes helper functions for handling TFTP opcodes (e.g., ACK, ERROR) and data transfer-related tasks.

To run this example:

1. Save the code in a file called `tftpd.py`.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install asyncio` if you don't have them already.
3. Start the server with the following command: `python -m tftpd.tftpd [port]`, replacing `[port]` with the desired port number (e.g., 69). The default file to be served is `testfile.txt`.
4. Use any TFTP client to connect and download the test file from the server. For example, you can use GnuTFTP or tftp-hpa on Linux or Windows.
