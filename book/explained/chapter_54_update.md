## Chapter 54: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/update.py

 The `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/update.py` file is a Python script within the larger Jumpstarter project. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) to update specific resources, with a primary focus on updating leases in this particular instance.

   The script starts by defining the `update` function as a click group. This means that it contains multiple subcommands, each serving a unique purpose. In this case, the only defined subcommand is `lease`.

   The `update_lease` function is the most significant within this file. It accepts arguments such as the name of the lease to be updated and the duration for which the update should last. After parsing these arguments, it updates the lease in the configuration object provided (`config`) and then outputs the updated lease information based on the user's desired output format.

   The available output formats are JSON, YAML, a single name, or a table containing the name, selector, duration, client, and exporter of the updated lease. These output formats are controlled by the `OutputType` enumeration defined in the `jumpstarter_cli_common.opt` module.

   The script utilizes other modules within the Jumpstarter project to handle exceptions (using `handle_exceptions`) and to parse command-line options (using `opt_*` functions). It also relies on the `datetime` module for handling date and time operations, such as calculating a timedelta.

   Example use cases include updating a lease's duration for a specific resource or viewing the updated lease information in the desired format. For instance:

   ```bash
   jumpstarter-cli update lease my_resource --duration 1h --output json
   ```

   In this example, the lease associated with `my_resource` will be updated to last for one hour, and the updated lease information will be output in JSON format.

        LeaseManager-->>Config: updated Lease object

        Config-->CLI: return the updated Lease object
        CLI-->>User: display output based on user preference
