## Chapter 73: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-dutlink/examples/dutlink.py

 This chapter will discuss the purpose and functionality of the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-dutlink/examples/dutlink.py` within the Jumpstarter project. This script serves as a command-line tool for interacting with a specific device, called Dutlink, which is assumed to be part of the larger system under test (SUT).

   The main purpose of this script is to establish a connection to the Dutlink device, perform certain operations such as writing a system image, power management, and checking the operating system version, and finally disconnect from the device. This tool provides a convenient way to automate common tasks on Dutlink devices.

   Important functions and classes within this script include:

   1. `PexpectAdapter`: This is an adapter class used for Expect support (Expect is a Tcl library for writing test programs but can be used in other contexts). It is imported from the jumpstarter-driver-network package.

   2. The `ClientConfigV1Alpha1`, `lease()`, and `connect()` methods: These are not explicitly defined within this script, but they are assumed to come from the `jumpstarter.config.client` module. They help initialize a client instance using configuration data. However, in this specific example, the client is initialized from the environment instead of config data.

   This code fits into the project as part of the Dutlink device driver examples. It provides a convenient way to interact with the Dutlink device when running within the Jumpstarter framework.

   Example use cases for this script could be:

   1. Automating the process of writing a new system image to multiple Dutlink devices at once using a single command.
   2. Simplifying power management tasks such as turning on or off multiple Dutlink devices in one go.
   3. Verifying that the correct operating system version is installed on each Dutlink device by checking the output of the `uname -a` command.

   To run this script, users can execute the following command within their terminal:
   ```
   jmp-exporter shell dutlink
   ```
   This will connect to a Dutlink device and perform the operations defined within the script as described above.

        participant Console as Console

        Exporter->>DUT: Connect
        Exporter->>DUT: Write system image (/tmp/nixos-visionfive2.img)
        Exporter->>DUT: Connect storage device
        Exporter->>DUT: Power on
        Note over DUT,Console: Wait for boot menu
        Console-->DUT: Enter choice:
        DUT->>Console: Boot entry selected (1)
        Note over DUT,Console: Wait for login prompt
        Console-->DUT: nixos@nixos
        Note over DUT,Console: Login successful
        DUT-->>Exporter: uname -a
        Note over DUT,Console: System information displayed
        Exporter->>DUT: Power off
    ```

This sequence diagram shows the interaction between the `Exporter`, `DUTLink` (representing the device under test), and the `Console`. The Exporter initiates the connection to the DUT, writes the system image, connects the storage device, powers on the DUT, waits for the boot menu and login prompt, receives the system information from the DUT, and finally powers off the DUT.
