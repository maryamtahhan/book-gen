## Chapter 2: jumpstarter/docs/source/conf.py

 This chapter will explain the purpose and functionality of the file `jumpstarter/docs/source/conf.py`. The `conf.py` file is a configuration file for Sphinx, a popular tool used for generating project documentation in multiple formats from reStructuredText or Markdown sources.

   In this specific case, the `conf.py` file sets up the configuration options for the Jumpstarter project's documentation. By customizing the `conf.py` file, users can tailor the appearance, functionality, and organization of their Sphinx-generated documentation to best suit their needs.

   Some important functions or classes in this file include:

   - `project`, `copyright`, `author`: These are project metadata variables that define the title, copyright holder, and authors for the documentation.
   - `extensions`: An array of extensions that will be used by Sphinx during the building process. The list includes `sphinxcontrib.mermaid`, `sphinxcontrib.programoutput`, `myst_parser`, `sphinx.ext.autodoc`, `sphinx.ext.doctest`, `sphinx_click`, `sphinx_substitution_extensions`, and `sphinx_copybutton`.
   - `templates_path` and `exclude_patterns`: These variables define the path to custom templates and patterns to exclude when searching for source files.
   - `mermaid_version`: The version of the Mermaid extension used in this project's documentation.
   - `suppress_warnings`: An array of warnings that should be suppressed during the building process.
   - `html_theme`, `html_title`, `html_logo`, and `html_favicon`: These variables define the theme, title, logo, and favicon for the HTML output of the documentation.
   - `get_controller_version()` and `get_index_url()`: Custom functions that provide information about the latest compatible controller version and the index URL to use for multi-version support.
   - `myst_heading_anchors`, `myst_enable_extensions`, `myst_substitutions`: These variables customize the MyST (My Standards in reStructuredText) parser used by Sphinx.
   - `doctest_test_doctest_blocks`: A variable that defines whether or not doctests should be executed during the building process.
   - `html_js_files`, `html_static_path`, and `html_css_files`: These variables define JavaScript, static files, and CSS files to include in the HTML output of the documentation, respectively.
   - `html_sidebars`: An object that defines the sidebars to display for different sections of the documentation.
   - `html_theme_options`: A dictionary containing additional options for customizing the selected theme.
   - `copybutton_prompt_text`, `copybutton_prompt_is_regexp`, `copybutton_only_copy_prompt_lines`, and `copybutton_line_continuation_character`: These variables customize the behavior of the `sphinx_copybutton` extension.

   This code fits into the project by providing the necessary configuration to generate high-quality documentation for the Jumpstarter project using Sphinx. The example use case is that a developer working on the Jumpstarter project will customize this file according to their preferences and requirements, and then run Sphinx commands to build and publish the updated documentation.
