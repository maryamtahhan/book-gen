## Chapter 211: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/client/grpc.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/client/grpc.py` is a module in the Jumpstarter project that defines classes and functions for interacting with the Jumpstart API via gRPC calls using Python. This module primarily focuses on the ClientService, which acts as an interface to call the Jumpstart API methods related to client resources (e.g., exporters and leases).

   The most important classes in this file are:

   1. `Exporter`: Represents an exporter resource managed by Jumpstart. This class contains various attributes such as namespace, name, labels, and a method to convert the underlying protobuf object to Pydantic's `BaseModel`.

   2. `Lease`: Represents a lease resource in Jumpstart. It has attributes like namespace, name, selector, duration, client, exporter, conditions, effective_begin_time, and methods to dump its data as JSON or YAML.

   3. `ExporterList` & `LeaseList`: These are lists of `Exporter` and `Lease` objects, respectively, along with pagination information for navigating through the resources.

   The `ClientService` class provides various methods to interact with the Jumpstart API, including:
   - Retrieving a specific exporter or lease by name using the `GetExporter` and `GetLease` methods
   - Listing all exporters or leases within a namespace using the `ListExporters` and `ListLeases` methods
   - Creating a new lease with the specified duration and selector using the `CreateLease` method
   - Updating an existing lease's duration using the `UpdateLease` method
   - Deleting a lease by name using the `DeleteLease` method

   These methods use the gRPC stubs for ClientService to communicate with the Jumpstart API and convert the protobuf responses into Pydantic models for easier consumption.

   The `MultipathExporterStub` is a convenience class that allows connecting to multiple channels to the exporter service, using the first ready channel for communication. This can be useful when dealing with network conditions or load balancing.
