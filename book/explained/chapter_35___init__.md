## Chapter 35: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-driver/jumpstarter_cli_driver/__init__.py

 In the project, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-driver/jumpstarter_cli_driver/__init__.py` serves as the entry point for the command-line interface (CLI) tool specifically designed for managing drivers within the Jumpstarter ecosystem. This CLI tool is created using the Click library, a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces.

   The file imports necessary modules from other packages in the project: `jumpstarter_cli_common`, which provides common functionalities such as command grouping (AliasedGroup), option handling (opt_log_level), and version information (version).

   The main functionality of this file is encapsulated within the `driver()` function, which creates a Click-based command group named 'driver'. This group can contain multiple commands related to managing drivers. In this case, there are two defined commands: `list_drivers` for listing all available drivers and `version` for displaying the version of the Jumpstarter CLI tool itself.

   The command group is decorated with an AliasedGroup class from `jumpstarter_cli_common`, allowing users to use both 'driver' and its aliases (if any) interchangeably. Furthermore, the opt_log_level decorator is applied to allow users to set the logging level for the CLI tool.

   The last section, `if __name__ == "__main__": driver()`, indicates that this script should be run directly when called from the command line, and it executes the 'driver' command group.

   In a use case scenario, a user might call the `jumpstarter-cli-driver` command followed by appropriate subcommands like `list_drivers` or `version` to interact with the Jumpstarter driver CLI tool. For instance, if a user wants to view a list of available drivers, they would run:

   ```
   jumpstarter-cli-driver list_drivers
   ```

   Alternatively, if a user needs to know the version of the Jumpstarter CLI tool, they can simply execute:

   ```
   jumpstarter-cli-driver version
   ```

      CommonLib-->>Cli: Return initialized logger
      Cli->>DriverLib: Get driver command group
      DriverLib-->Cli: Return driver group object
      User->>Cli: Choose a command (list_drivers or version)
      Cli->>DriverLib: Call chosen command function
      DriverLib-->>Cli: Execute command and return result
      User<--Cli: Display the result
   ```

This diagram shows a sequence of events when running a command from the Jumpstarter driver CLI tool. The user interacts with the CLI, which in turn uses common libraries to initialize the logger and handle the chosen command. The Driver Lib is responsible for providing the appropriate functions (in this case, `list_drivers` or `version`) to be executed by the CLI, and it returns the result back to the user via the CLI.
