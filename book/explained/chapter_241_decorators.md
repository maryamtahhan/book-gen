## Chapter 241: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/driver/decorators.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter/jumpstarter/driver/decorators.py` is a module within the JumpStarter project that contains Python decorator functions used to annotate certain methods with specific metadata for identification and processing. These decorators are primarily used in defining driver calls and streams.

   There are two main decorators defined in this file: `export` and `exportstream`. Both of these decorators modify the behavior of a function by adding metadata that helps identify the function as either a driver call or a stream. The purpose of this metadata is to enable automated processing of these functions later on in the system.

   Here's a brief description of each decorator:

   - `export(func)`: This decorator marks a function as a driver call. If the function is either an async generator or a coroutine, it sets the MARKER_STREAMING_DRIVERCALL metadata. If the function is a regular function or coroutine, it sets the MARKER_DRIVERCALL metadata.
   - `exportstream(func)`: This decorator marks a function as a stream. It always sets the MARKer_STREAMCALL metadata.

   These decorators fit into the larger project by helping to define and organize the various functions that make up the driver logic of JumpStarter. By using these decorators, developers can more easily identify and manage which functions are responsible for driving calls or handling streams within the system.

   Example use cases may include defining a method that sends data to an external API as part of a driver call or implementing a generator-based function that reads from a file or stream in chunks as part of a stream processing pipeline. By using the `export` and `exportstream` decorators, these functions can be easily identified and integrated into the overall system flow.

   sequenceDiagram
      participant User as User
      participant DriverCall as DriverCall
      participant StreamCall as StreamCall
      participant ExportedFunction as ExportedFunction

      User->>ExportedFunction: Call function
      ExportedFunction-->|has marker|DriverCall: If driver call marker
         DriverCall-->User: Return result
      ExportedFunction-->|has no marker|StreamCall: If stream call marker
         StreamCall-->>User: Start streaming results
         Note over User, StreamCall: While data is available
           User->>StreamCall: Receive data
         end
```

In this sequence diagram, a user calls an `ExportedFunction`. The function checks whether it has the "driver call" marker or "stream call" marker. If it has the "driver call" marker, the function returns a result directly to the user. If it has the "stream call" marker, the function starts streaming results to the user, and the user keeps receiving data until there's no more data available.
