 Chapter Title: Understanding the Core Execution File `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/__main__.py`

   This chapter discusses the core execution file, `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/__main__.py`, in the Jumpstarter project. It serves as the entry point for running the Jumpstarter Command Line Interface (CLI) in administration mode using the command `python -m jumpstart_cli_admin`.

   The primary purpose of this file is to import and execute the `admin` module, which contains the core logic for the administrative functions of Jumpstarter. The `admin` function is defined within the `admin.py` module, making it accessible through this entry point.

   Here's a brief overview of the important functions or classes within this file:

   - `admin(prog_name="jmp-admin")`: This function initializes the Jumpstarter CLI in administrative mode. It takes one argument, `prog_name`, which is used to define the name of the program for error messages and other diagnostic purposes.

   The code within this file fits into the project as the entry point for running the administrative commands of Jumpstarter. When executed with the command `python -m jumpstart_cli_admin`, it sets up the environment, loads necessary modules, and calls the `admin()` function to execute the desired administrative tasks.

   Example use cases include:
   - Managing users and their permissions within the Jumpstarter system
   - Configuring project settings and parameters
   - Troubleshooting issues and performing maintenance tasks on the Jumpstarter instance.

   By understanding this file, you will gain insight into how to interact with the Jumpstarter system at an administrative level, enabling you to customize and manage your project effectively.

      M->>U: python -m jumpstarter_cli_admin
      M-->|Invoke admin function|M: __main__.py
      M-->>U: Welcome to Jumpstarter Admin Interface
      Note over M,U: (User provides commands)
      U-->>M: command1
      M-->>U: Result of command1
      U-->>M: command2
      M-->>U: Result of command2
      ...
      U->>M: exit
      M-->>U: Exiting Jumpstarter Admin Interface
   ```

This diagram represents the interaction between the Manager (representing the script) and the User. The user runs the script using `python -m jumpstart_cli_admin`, which in turn invokes the admin function from the main module. The user can then provide commands, and the manager returns the results of those commands until the user decides to exit.
