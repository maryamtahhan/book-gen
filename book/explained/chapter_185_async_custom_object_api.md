## Chapter 185: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-kubernetes/jumpstarter_kubernetes/util/async_custom_object_api.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-kubernetes/jumpstarter_kubernetes/util/async_custom_object_api.py` serves as an abstract class for creating and managing an asynchronous Kubernetes API client focused on CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) and CustomObjects. This custom API client provides a context-aware, namespaced method to interact with CRDs and their associated objects.

   The primary class in this file is `AbstractAsyncCustomObjectApi`, an extension of the built-in Python `AbstractAsyncContextManager`. This abstract class allows users to work with a Kubernetes API client in an asynchronous context, while taking advantage of context managers for easier resource management. Key methods and attributes within this class include:

   - `_client` (ApiClient): The underlying Kubernetes API client instance.
   - `config_file` (Optional[str]): The path to the kubeconfig file.
   - `context` (Optional[str]): The name of the active kubectl context.
   - `namespace` (str): The target namespace for all API operations.
   - `api` (CustomObjectsApi): The custom objects API instance, used to interact with CRDs and their associated objects.
   - `core_api` (CoreV1Api): The core API instance, which provides access to common Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, etc.

   To use this class, developers can instantiate an object of the `AbstractAsyncCustomObjectApi` and call its methods asynchronously within an asynchronous context, like a coroutine or async-await function.

Example usage:

```python
async with AsyncCustomObjectApi('default', '/path/to/kubeconfig') as api:
    # Get the list of custom objects in the 'default' namespace
    custom_objects = await api.api.list_namespaced_custom_object(group='mygroup', version='v1', plural='mypersistentvolumeclaim', namespace='default')
```

In the Jumpstarter project, this code is used to manage various Kubernetes resources that may have custom definitions or behaviors. It helps simplify interactions with these resources and streamline their creation, deletion, and updates by providing a consistent, namespaced interface for asynchronous operations.

        participant User as User
        participant AsyncCustomObjectApi as CustomObjectAPI
        participant CoreV1Api as CoreV1API
        User->>CustomObjectAPI: Create instance(namespace, config_file, context)
        CustomObjectAPI->>CoreV1API: Initialize CoreV1API using _client
        CustomObjectAPI->>CoreV1API: Initialize self.api using _client
        CustomObjectAPI->>User: Returns instance for use

        User->>CustomObjectAPI: Call some method(...) async
        CustomObjectAPI->>CoreV1API: Forward the call to CoreV1API
        await CoreV1API: Execute the request
        CoreV1API-->>CustomObjectAPI: Response from Kubernetes API
        CustomObjectAPI-->>User: Result of the operation(...)

        User->>CustomObjectAPI: Close instance
        CustomObjectAPI-->CoreV1API: __aexit__ called on CoreV1API
        await CoreV1API: Cleanup and exit context
        CustomObjectAPI-->User: Exit with None
    ```

This mermaid sequence diagram shows the interaction between the `User`, `AsyncCustomObjectApi`, and `CoreV1Api`. The user creates an instance of `AsyncCustomObjectApi` by passing necessary parameters. The instance initializes a `CoreV1Api` object internally. When a method is called on the `AsyncCustomObjectApi` instance, it forwards the call to the `CoreV1Api` object. After processing the request, the response is returned back to the user through the `AsyncCustomObjectApi`. Finally, when the user closes the instance, the `__aexit__` method is called on both the `CoreV1Api` and `AsyncCustomObjectApi`, cleaning up and exiting the context.
