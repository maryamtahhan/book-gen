 Title: Understanding the Role of `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/blocking.py` in the JumpStarter Project

   This chapter provides an overview of the purpose and functionality of the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-common/jumpstarter_cli_common/blocking.py`.

   **Overview**

   The `blocking.py` file in the JumpStarter project is a Python module that offers a decorator function named `blocking()`. This decorator aims to convert asynchronous functions into synchronous ones, enabling them to be called from within other non-async code contexts.

   **Functions and Classes**

   The `blocking(f)` function is the primary element of this module. It takes a function (`f`) as an argument and returns a wrapper function that handles the execution of the original function as a synchronous operation using the built-in Python asyncio library.

     1. `@wraps(f)` - This decorator copies the attributes like name, docstring, and more from the original function `f` to the wrapper function, ensuring tracebacks remain useful.
     2. `run(f(*args, **kwargs))` - The `asyncio.run()` function is used here to execute the asynchronous function `f` in a synchronous manner, waiting for its completion before returning the result.

   **Project Fit**

   In the JumpStarter project, this module enables developers to call asynchronous functions (which are common in the project due to their performance advantages) from within synchronous code sections. This facilitates better organization and readability of the code while still maintaining high performance through the use of asynchronous operations when needed.

   **Example Use Cases**

   Suppose you have an asynchronous function `fetch_data()` that retrieves data from a remote API. In some parts of your application, you may want to call this function directly instead of using an async context or an event loop. To do so, you can apply the `blocking` decorator to `fetch_data()`, allowing it to be called as follows:

   ```python
   from jumpstarter.packages.jumpstarter-cli-common.jumpstarter_cli_common import blocking

   @blocking
   async def fetch_data():
       # Async code that fetches data goes here
       pass

   # Call the function synchronously
   result = fetch_data()
   ```

    participant User as U
    participant BlockingFunction as BF
    participant Coroutine as Co

    U->>BF: Call blocking function
    BF->>Co: Wrap coroutine with run from asyncio
    Co->>U: Starts executing, but blocks
    Note over Co: (Coroutine waits for I/O or another task)
    U->>Co: Triggers an event that completes the coroutine
    Co-->>U: Resumes execution and returns result
    BF-->>U: Returns the result from the coroutine

    Note left of BF: Wraps coroutines to ensure they don't block the event loop
