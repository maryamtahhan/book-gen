## Chapter 123: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-pyserial/jumpstarter_driver_pyserial/client.py

 This chapter focuses on the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-pyserial/jumpstarter_driver_pyserial/client.py` file, a vital component of the Jumpstarter project which deals with handling serial communication using the pexpect library.

The primary class defined in this file is `PySerialClient`, a subclass of `DriverClient`. This class is responsible for managing serial communication sessions using pexpect sessions. It provides an interface to interact with devices connected through a serial port.

Two important functions are:
1. `open()`: This function opens a pexpect session, which serves as the foundation for further interaction with the device connected through the serial port. You can find more details about pexpect's spawn class in its official documentation at https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pexpect.html#spawn-class

2. `pexpect()`: This function creates a context manager that returns a PexpectAdapter object, allowing for convenient handling of the pexpect session within with statements.

Additionally, this class provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) using the click library to interact with the serial port console. The CLI consists of two commands: `start_console`, which starts the serial port console and `base`, which serves as the command group for other possible commands that may be added in the future.

Example use cases include connecting to a device via a serial port, sending commands, receiving responses, and monitoring device output within the console or through scripts that interact with the CLI. These functionalities are particularly useful when working with hardware devices like microcontrollers or other embedded systems.

        Console->>User: Start serial port console ... exit with CTRL+B x 3 times

        User->>Console: Input (Interaction with the console)
        Console-->PySerialClient: send_data()
        PySerialClient->>PexpectAdapter: sendline(data)
        PexpectAdapter->>Console: write(data)

        Console-->>User: Output from the device (console display)
        User->>Console: Input (Interaction with the console continues)
        ...
        Console-->PySerialClient: close()
        PySerialClient->>PexpectAdapter: sendline("exit")
        PexpectAdapter->>Console: sendline("exit")
        Console-->>User: Exit from serial port console
    ```

   This mermaid diagram shows the interaction between the `User`, `PySerialClient`, `Console`, and `PexpectAdapter` when using the `start_console()` function. The user interacts with the console, which sends data to the PySerialClient through the PexpectAdapter. The PySerialClient handles the communication with the actual device over serial port.
