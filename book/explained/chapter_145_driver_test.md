## Chapter 145: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-snmp/jumpstarter_driver_snmp/driver_test.py

 In the `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-snmp/jumpstarter_driver_snmp/driver_test.py` file, a series of tests are conducted to verify the functionality and behavior of the SNMPServer class in the JumpStarter-Driver-SNMP package.

   The primary purpose of this test script is to ensure that the SNMPServer can handle various authentication configurations (noAuth, MD5, SHA, or DES) when it is initialized with different parameters. Moreover, it checks whether the SNMPServer can execute power on and power off commands correctly.

   The following are the important functions and classes in this test script:

   - `setup_mock_snmp_engine()`: Creates a mock pysnmp engine object for testing purposes.

   - `MockMibObject`: A custom mock class that mocks the behavior of a SNMP MIB object, used to simulate instances of pysnmp's built-in classes in test scenarios.

   - Test functions like `test_snmp_auth_configurations`, `test_power_on_command`, and `test_power_off_command`: These functions create mock objects, initialize the SNMPServer with different parameter combinations, and verify that the server responds as expected according to its design.

   This test script fits within the larger project by ensuring that the SNMPServer component of the JumpStarter-Driver-SNMP package works as intended. It helps in maintaining the quality and reliability of the codebase by catching potential issues early during development.

   Example use cases for the tested functionality include setting up an SNMP server with specific authentication configurations, sending power on/off commands to managed devices using SNMP, and verifying that the communication between the SNMP server and devices is functioning properly.

 Here's a Mermaid sequence diagram to visualize the interaction between the key functions when running the tests:

    Note over Server: Initialize with user, plug, and authentication config
    SNMPServer->>PySnmpEngine: Create Engine instance
    PySnmpEngine-->>SNMPServer: Return mock engine instance

    Note over Server: Set up SNMP configuration
    SNMPServer->>AddUser: Add v3 user with provided parameters
    AddUser-->>SNMPServer: Add user to the engine

    Note over Server: Configure transport and target parameters
    SNMPServer->>PySnmpEngine: Add target address, parameters, and transport
    PySnmpEngine-->>SNMPServer: Engine configuration updated

    Note over Server: Start SNMP engine transport
    PySnmpEngine->>PySnmpEngine: Start transport dispatcher

    Note over Server: Execute power on/off command
    SNMPServer->>SCG: Create SetCommandGenerator instance with command and params
    SCG-->>SNMPServer: Return SetCommandGenerator instance

    Note over Server: Send the generated command to SNMP engine
    SNMPServer->>SCG: Send varbinds using send_varbinds method
    SCG->>AsyncIOEventLoop: Execute command asynchronously
    AsyncIOEventLoop->>RunTimeError: Raise RuntimeError (for testing purposes)
    RunTimeError-->>AsyncIOEventLoop: Return None
    AsyncIOEventLoop-->>SNMPServer: Command execution completed
    SNMPServer-->>Server: Update state and send confirmation message
