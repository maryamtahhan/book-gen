## Chapter 136: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-sdwire/jumpstarter_driver_sdwire/driver.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-sdwire/jumpstarter_driver_sdwire/driver.py` serves as the driver for an SD Wire device in the JumpStarter project. This device is used to program Flash memory on a variety of microcontrollers, primarily those based on the AVR architecture.

   The `SDWire` class extends both `StorageMuxFlasherInterface` and `Driver`, combining the functionalities of a storage device driver and a flash programming interface. Here's a brief description of some important functions and classes:

   - **Effective Storage Device**: The `effective_storage_device()` function is responsible for finding the block device associated with the SD Wire device by iterating through the system's udev devices and filtering out the appropriate block devices.

   - **Initialization (`__post_init__`)**: The `__post_init__` method initializes the SDWire object by searching for an SD Wire device with a specific vendor and product ID using `usb.core.find()`. It also checks if the provided serial number matches the device's serial number, and sets the appropriate attributes.

   - **Selecting Target (`select`)**: The `select(target)` method sends a command to the SD Wire device to select the desired target: either the host or the development unit (dut).

   - **Querying Target (`query`)**: The `query()` function checks the current selected target by sending a command to the SD Wire device and returning 'host' or 'dut'.

   - **Host/DUT Functions (`host`, `dut`)**: These functions are decorators with the `@export` decorator, which allows them to be called as methods on an instance of the `SDWire` class. They simply call the `select()` method with appropriate arguments to select either the host or the development unit.

   - **Writing/Reading Functions (`write`, `read`)**: These functions are also decorated with the `@export` decorator, allowing them to be called as methods on an instance of the `SDWire` class. They perform read and write operations on the connected storage device using the `jumpstarter.common.storage.read_from_storage_device` and `write_to_storage_device` functions, respectively.

   This code fits into the project by handling the communication with an SD Wire device and providing a way to read from and write to its connected storage devices, which are essential for flashing firmware onto microcontrollers. Example use cases would include flashing a new firmware image onto an AVR-based microcontroller or reading data stored on the microcontroller's flash memory.
