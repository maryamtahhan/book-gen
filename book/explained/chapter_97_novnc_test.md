## Chapter 97: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/novnc_test.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/novnc_test.py` is a Python script designed for testing the NovncAdapter class within the Jumpstarter project, which is likely an automation or orchestration tool.

   The main function in this file is `test_client_adapter_novnc()`, which sets up a test environment to verify the correct functioning of the NovncAdapter class. This function creates a temporary TCP listener that listens for incoming connections and serves them through a TcpNetwork object. It then initializes an instance of the NovncAdapter class using the created TCP network as its client.

   The test case utilizes a non-blocking asynchronous I/O library (anyio) to handle the communication between the test server and client, and the websocket library to establish a WebSocket connection with the NovncAdapter instance. The function sends a message "hello" through the WebSocket connection and checks if the response is the same by using an assert statement.

   The purpose of this file is to ensure that the NovncAdapter class functions correctly when handling connections, forwarding requests, and maintaining communication with connected clients in the context of the Jumpstarter project. This test case can help catch any issues or regressions during development and contribute to a more robust system.

   In a practical application, this code might be used as part of the testing suite for the jumpstarter-driver-network package, allowing developers to confirm that the NovncAdapter is functioning as intended when integrated into larger automation workflows provided by Jumpstarter.

      participant TcpNetwork as TCP Network
      participant NovncAdapter as NOVNC Adapter
      participant TemporaryTcpListener as TempTCP Listener
      participant Websocket as WebSocket

      Note over TCP Network: Starts a temporary TcpListener
      TCP Network->>TempTCP Listener: Start echo_handler

      TempTCP Listener-->>TCP Network: Returns address (host, port)

      activate TCP Network
      TCP Network->>Jumpstarter: Serve with given host and port

      Note over NovncAdapter: Initializes adapter with client (TCP Network instance)
      NovncAdapter->>Jumpstarter: Gets URL for NOVNC connection

      Note over NovncAdapter: Parses URL query parameters to get host and port

      activate Websocket
      NovncAdapter-->>Websocket: Creates WebSocket connection with parsed host and port

      WebSocket-->>NovncAdapter: Pings the server
      WebSocket->>NovncAdapter: Sends message "hello"
      Note over NovncAdapter: Forwards the message to TcpNetwork (TCP Network instance)
      NovncAdapter-->>Websocket: Receives response from the server
      WebSocket->>NovncAdapter: Parses response as bytes
      WebSocket->>NovncAdapter: Compares received bytes with "hello"
      Note over NovncAdapter: Asserts that the received bytes are equal to "hello"
