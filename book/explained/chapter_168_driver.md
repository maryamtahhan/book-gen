## Chapter 168: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-yepkit/jumpstarter_driver_yepkit/driver.py

 The `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-yepkit/jumpstarter_driver_yepkit/driver.py` file in the project is a driver for Yepkit Ykush USB Hub with power control, implemented as a subclass of `Driver` and `PowerInterface`. This driver allows communication with a specific USB device (Ykush) via USB commands to control its ports' power states (on or off).

   Key functions within this file include:

   - The constructor method, `__init__`, which initializes the object with required attributes and validates the provided port and default parameters. It also handles device connection and locking for synchronization access to avoid multiple instances of the same device.
   - The `_send_cmd` function, which sends a command to the USB device over the OUT endpoint and reads the response from the IN endpoint.
   - The `_get_endpoints` function, which finds the first available IN and OUT endpoints for communication with the USB device.

   The driver also has methods for resetting the default state (the `reset()` method) and controlling the power state on/off (`on()`, `off()`) of ports on the Ykush hub. These functions are decorated with `@export` to make them available to other parts of the project.

   The driver fits into the larger project as part of a collection of device drivers that allow users to interact with and control various USB devices in the Jumpstarter ecosystem. For example, this driver could be used in conjunction with other device drivers in an automation scenario where you want to turn on/off multiple devices connected to the Yepkit Ykush hub based on some conditions or triggers.
