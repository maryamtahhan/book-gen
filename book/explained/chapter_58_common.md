## Chapter 58: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-can/jumpstarter_driver_can/common.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-can/jumpstarter_driver_can/common.py` serves as a central repository for utility classes and functions that are used across the CAN (Controller Area Network) driver in the JumpStarter project.

   The key components within this file include:

1. `CanMessage` - This class represents an internal message structure that is used to transmit data via gRPC. It contains various attributes such as timestamp, arbitration_id, data, etc., which correspond to the essential parameters of a CAN message.

2. `IsoTpParams`, `IsoTpMessage`, `IsoTpAddress`, and `IsoTpAsymmetricAddress` - These classes are used to work with ISO-TP (ISO 15765-CAN High-layer protocol), a higher layer protocol on top of the CAN bus. The classes allow for configuration, creation, and manipulation of ISO-TP parameters, messages, addresses, and asymmetric addresses respectively.

3. Various utility functions - This includes class methods like `construct()` in the `CanMessage` class that help to construct instances from raw data, and the `apply()` method in the `IsoTpParams` class that applies configuration parameters to a socket.

   These classes and functions are crucial for the proper functioning of the CAN driver within the JumpStarter project, as they provide a uniform interface for handling CAN-related operations, such as sending and receiving ISO-TP messages. Example use cases include configuring and communicating with devices attached to a CAN bus in an autonomous vehicle or industrial automation system.

        Note over CanDriver, IsoTpMessage, IsoTpAddress: This process may involve encoding the ISO-TP message and addressing data.

    ```

   This sequence diagram shows how the user sends a CAN message to the CanDriver class, which then initializes ISO-TP parameters, converts the CAN message to an ISO-TP message, creates an ISO-TP address, and sends it over the CAN bus. The CanDriver also listens for incoming ISO-TP messages on the CAN bus, extracts their data, creates a new CAN message from that data, and returns it to the user.
