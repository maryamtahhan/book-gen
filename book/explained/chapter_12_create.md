## Chapter 12: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/create.py

 In the given code, we have a Python script called `create.py` which is part of the Jumpstarter CLI Admin package (located at `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin`). This script provides functionality to create Kubernetes objects (specifically, clients and exporters) for the Jumpstarter project.

   The primary function in this script is `create_client()`, which allows users to create a client object in their Kubernetes cluster. It accepts various command-line options such as `--name`, `--save`, `--allow`, `--unsafe`, and others, allowing the user to customize the creation of the client object. The function uses the `ClientsV1Alpha1Api` class from the `jumpstarter_kubernetes` module to interact with the Kubernetes API.

   Similarly, there is another command-line function called `create_exporter()`, which allows users to create an exporter object in their Kubernetes cluster, accepting similar options as `create_client()`.

   These functions are wrapped within a Click group (`@click.group(cls=AliasedGroup)`) named "create", which can be called with the command `jumpstarter-cli admin create client` or `jumpstarter-cli admin create exporter`.

   The output of these commands can be specified using options such as JSON, YAML, or simply the name of the object. Additionally, users can choose to save the configuration file for the created objects if desired.

   In summary, this script allows users to programmatically create client and exporter objects within their Kubernetes cluster using the Jumpstarter CLI Admin tool.
