## Chapter 46: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/create.py

 In this chapter, we will discuss the purpose and functionality of the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/create.py`. This file is a part of the JumpStarter Command Line Interface (CLI) and contains several important functions related to creating resources, primarily leases in this case.

   The `create.py` file defines a command group named `create` which serves as a container for all creation-related commands. One such command is `lease`, responsible for requesting an exporter lease from the JumpStarter controller.

   The `create_lease()` function, nested within the `create_lease` command, is responsible for creating a new lease based on provided options like selector and duration. It creates a lease object using the configuration instance's `create_lease()` method.

   The command also accepts various output modes (JSON, YAML, NAME, or table format) to customize how the lease information is displayed. Based on the specified output mode, the command uses either click.echo for simple text formats or makes use of the make_table function from `jumpstarter_cli_common.table` module to present data in a tabular format.

   The provided example demonstrates how to request an exporter lease and use its ID for further operations like connecting to the remote exporter, performing other commands, and finally deleting the lease when no longer required.

   In summary, `create.py` file serves as the entry point for creating leases using JumpStarter CLI. This functionality is essential for managing resources in multi-step workflows or for automating operations in continuous integration environments.

       User->>CLI: jmp create lease
       CLI-->>User: Enter selector, duration and output (optional)
       CLI->>Config: Get config and options
       Config->>JumpstarterController: Request a lease with provided parameters
       JumpstarterController->>Config: Return the created lease object
       Config-->CLI: Pass the lease object to the CLI
       CLI-->>User: Display output based on user's preference (JSON, YAML or table)
   ```

This mermaid sequence diagram visualizes the interactions between the User, CLI, Config and JumpstarterController objects in the `create_lease` command of the `jumpstarter-cli`. The User initializes the process by invoking the `jmp create lease` command, followed by entering relevant options such as selector, duration and output (optional). The CLI then interacts with the Config to obtain these options and passes them to the JumpstarterController to request a new lease. Upon receiving the created lease object from the JumpstarterController, the Config sends it back to the CLI, which then displays the output according to the User's preference.
