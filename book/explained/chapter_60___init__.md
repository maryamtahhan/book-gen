 Title: Understanding the `jumpstarter_driver_composite` Module in the JumpStarter Project

   In the JumpStarter project, the file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-composite/jumpstarter_driver_composite/__init__.py` serves as a critical entry point for the Composite Driver component. This module defines the main structure and functionality of the Composite Driver, which orchestrates multiple lower-level drivers to perform complex tasks within the project.

   The primary function of this module is to import and initialize submodules representing individual driver types (e.g., `SerialDriver`, `NetworkDriver`) that can be combined to create a composite driver. Each driver type provides an interface for interacting with specific hardware or software components.

   Here are some key elements within the `__init__.py` file:

   - `CompositeDriver` Class: This class acts as the main entry point for creating and managing composite drivers. It accepts a list of individual driver instances and provides methods to execute commands across all connected drivers (e.g., start, stop).

   In the JumpStarter project, the Composite Driver is used to automate multi-step tasks requiring interaction with multiple hardware or software components. For example, consider a scenario where you need to send data to a device through both serial and network interfaces simultaneously. In this case, you would create instances of `SerialDriver` and `NetworkDriver`, add them to a `CompositeDriver`, and then execute your sequence of commands using the composite driver.

   By abstracting the complexity of managing multiple drivers into the Composite Driver, the project gains flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. Developers can easily create new drivers for different hardware or software components without having to modify existing high-level code. This design pattern encourages modularity and reusability, making it easier to integrate new features or expand the capabilities of the JumpStarter system.

    DriverComposite<--UberService/LyftService: Update on ride progress
    DriverComposite->>User: Update Ride Progress

```
This mermaid sequence diagram illustrates how a user requests a ride, and the `DriverComposite` checks for available services from Uber and Lyft. The user is then presented with multiple options, allowing them to select their preferred service, which initiates the chosen service. Throughout the ride, the `DriverComposite` monitors status updates from both services and provides progress notifications to the user. When certain conditions are met, the ride is ended, and the user is notified of its completion.
