## Chapter 50: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/jmp.py

 The `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli/jumpstarter_cli/jmp.py` file is the main entry point for the Jumpstarter Command Line Interface (CLI) in your project. This module defines a collection of command-line commands that users can execute to interact with the Jumpstarter system.

   The primary function of this file is to create an instance of a Click Group, named `jmp`, which serves as a container for all the available commands within the CLI. Each command corresponds to a separate Python module within the same directory and represents a specific action that can be performed by users. For example, `create`, `delete`, `update`, `get`, `shell`, `run`, `login`, `config` are individual commands that perform actions such as creating, deleting, updating, or getting resources, logging in, accessing the shell, running tasks, and configuring the system respectively.

   The `jmp` group object is also decorated with several utility functions from other modules like `opt_log_level`, which allows users to set log levels for their commands, `AliasedGroup`, which enables aliases for each command, making them easier to remember, and `version`, which provides the version information of the CLI.

   In addition, the file also imports the `driver` module, which handles actual communication with Jumpstarter servers and backends, and `admin` module, which provides administration-related commands.

   To use this CLI, users would run the script from the command line, providing various arguments to execute specific commands. For example:
   ```
   jmp create my_resource --property1 value1 --property2 value2
   ```
   This command creates a new resource with properties `property1` and `property2`. Users can explore other available commands and their usage through the help option, such as `jmp --help` or `jmp [command] --help`.

   In summary, this file organizes and orchestrates all the individual command-line commands of the Jumpstarter CLI, providing a clear entry point for users to interact with the system.

      User->>CLI: Select command (e.g., create)
      CLI->>SelectedCommand: Execute command logic

      Note over CLI, Driver: If command requires driver interaction
        CLI->>Driver: Interact with Driver
        Driver-->>CLI: Response from Driver
      end

      Note over CLI, Admin: If command requires admin access
        CLI->>Admin: Authenticate (if not already authenticated)
        Admin-->>CLI: Authentication status
        CLI->>Admin: Perform administrative action (if required by the command)
        Admin-->>CLI: Response from Admin
      end
   ```

This diagram illustrates how the main functions of the Jumpstarter CLI interact, including user input, common functionality, driver interaction, and admin access.
