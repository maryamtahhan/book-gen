## Chapter 22: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/print.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/print.py` is a module that provides functions to display various types of data related to the Jumpstarter project. This module uses the Click library for command line interface and the Jumpstarter Kubernetes module for interacting with Kubernetes resources.

   Important functions in this module include:
   - `make_client_row()`, `print_client()`: These functions are used to display individual Jumpstarter Client resources in different output formats (JSON, YAML, Name, Table).
   - `print_clients()`: This function displays a list of Jumpstarter Clients in the specified namespace and output format.
   - `make_exporter_row()`, `get_device_rows()`, `print_exporter()`, `print_exporters()`: These functions are similar to the Client-related functions but for Jumpstarter Exporter resources, including the ability to display devices associated with each exporter.
   - `get_reason()`, `make_lease_row()`, `print_lease()`, `print_leases()`: These functions are used to display Jumpstarter Lease resources in different output formats.

   These functions are part of the command line interface for interacting with the Kubernetes resources managed by the Jumpstarter project. They provide a user-friendly way to view the status and details of these resources.

   Example use cases:
   - To list all Jumpstarter Clients in the default namespace in JSON format: `jumpstarter client print --namespace=default --output=json`
   - To display detailed information about a specific Jumpstarter Exporter, including its associated devices, in YAML format: `jumpstarter exporter print [exporter-name] --output=yaml --devices`
   - To view the status of all active leases in the default namespace in Table format: `jumpstarter lease print --namespace=default --output=table`

      Note over cliAdmin,k8sClient: If no resources found, throw an exception

      user->>cliAdmin: Run command for a specific resource (client or exporter) details
      cliAdmin->>k8sClient: Fetch the specified resource from Kubernetes cluster
      k8sClient-->>cliAdmin: Returns the requested resource
      cliAdmin->>user: Display the details of the resource in requested format (JSON, YAML, or names only)

      user->>cliAdmin: Run command for lease information
      cliAdmin->>k8sClient: Fetch leases from Kubernetes cluster
      k8sClient-->>cliAdmin: Returns the leases
      cliAdmin->>user: Display the leases in requested format (JSON, YAML, or names only)

      user->>exporter: Start an exporter
      exporter->>k8sClient: Register with Kubernetes cluster
      k8sClient-->>exporter: Successful registration

      user->>client: Register a client with an exporter
      client-->>exporter: Registration request
      exporter->>k8sClient: Update lease in Kubernetes cluster
      k8sClient-->>exporter: Lease created successfully
      exporter->>client: Lease granted, start sending data

      user->>exporter: Revoke a client from an exporter
      client->>exporter: Request revocation
      exporter->>k8sClient: Update lease in Kubernetes cluster
      k8sClient-->>exporter: Lease revoked successfully
      exporter->>client: Notify client of revocation
      client->>exporter: Stop sending data
   ```

This mermaid sequence diagram visualizes the interactions between a user, CLI Admin (command-line interface for administrative tasks), Kubernetes Client (responsible for interacting with the Kubernetes API), Exporter, and Client. It shows the steps to list resources, fetch details of specific resources, start and revoke clients from exporters, and the creation and revocation of leases in Kubernetes.
