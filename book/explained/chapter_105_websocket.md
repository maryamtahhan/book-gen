## Chapter 105: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/streams/websocket.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/streams/websocket.py` is a module within the larger JumpStarter project, which appears to be a comprehensive framework. This specific file contains two classes: `WebsocketServerStream` and `WebsocketClientStream`, both of which implement streaming functionality for WebSocket connections.

   The primary function of these classes is to manage bi-directional data communication using the WebSocket protocol between a server and a client. Each class inherits from `ObjectStream[bytes]`, a generic stream implementation that deals with bytes objects.

   Here's a brief overview of the key functions and attributes in both classes:

   - `WebsocketServerStream`:
     - `stream`: An AnyIO byte stream used for network communication.
     - `ws`: A WSConnection object, representing the WebSocket connection instance. This object is responsible for handling the WebSocket protocol's framing and event management.
     - `queue`: A tuple containing two memory object streams (send and receive) that allow buffering data sent from/received by the underlying WebSocket connection.
     - `send`, `receive`, and `send_eof` methods: Methods for sending, receiving, and closing the send channel, respectively. These methods communicate with the underlying WebSocket connection using the WSConnection's methods.
     - `aclose` method: A method for gracefully closing the stream by sending a close event to the remote connection and then closing the underlying AnyIO byte stream.

   - `WebsocketClientStream`:
     - `conn`: A WebSocket client connection object, representing the WebSocket connection instance.
     - `send`, `receive`, and `send_eof` methods: Similar to the server-side class, these methods handle sending, receiving, and closing the send channel for a WebSocket client connection. The `receive` method in this case simply reads data directly from the connected WebSocket client's receive function.
     - `aclose` method: A method for gracefully closing the stream by closing the underlying WebSocket client connection.

These classes fit into the JumpStarter project by providing a simple and consistent way to establish and manage bi-directional communication using the WebSocket protocol within various modules of the framework. They can be used in scenarios where real-time, two-way data exchange is required between a server and client over the WebSocket protocol.

Example use cases might include implementing a chat application or a real-time collaboration tool as part of the larger JumpStarter project.
