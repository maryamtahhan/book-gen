## Chapter 119: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-probe-rs/jumpstarter_driver_probe_rs/client.py

 The `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-probe-rs/jumpstarter_driver_probe_rs/client.py` file serves as a client interface for the probe-rs driver within the Jumpstarter project. This client is designed to allow remote communication and interaction with devices using the probe-rs software.

   The main class defined in this file is `ProbeRsClient`, which inherits from `DriverClient`. This class provides a set of methods for performing various operations on the target device:

   - `info()`: Retrieves information about the target device.
   - `reset()`: Resets the target, typically used after downloading a new image to start the device.
   - `erase()`: Erases the target's memory, which is a slow operation. Note that this function currently only prints a message and does not actually stream data back to the client.
   - `download(operator, path)`: Downloads a file from the server to the device using an `Operator` object for specifying the file system root and destination path.
   - `download_file(filepath)`: Simplified version of the download function for downloading local files.
   - `read(width, address, words)`: Reads data from the target's memory with the specified width, address, and number of words. The supported data widths are 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits.

   The client also includes a CLI (command-line interface), allowing users to interact with the device via commands such as `info`, `reset`, `erase`, `download`, and `read`. Each command corresponds to one of the methods defined in the class, and they provide a convenient way for users to issue commands and view their results.

   This code is part of the Jumpstarter project's driver-probe-rs package, which aims to facilitate communication between the Jumpstarter client and various target devices using the probe-rs software. In this context, the `client.py` file serves as a crucial link for managing devices and executing commands remotely.

   Example use cases:

   - To download a file from the server to the device:
     ```
     probe_rs_client = ProbeRsClient(...)  # create an instance of the client
     probe_rs_client.download("fs", "/path/to/target/file", "/path/to/local/file")
     ```
   - To read data from the target's memory:
     ```
     probe_rs_client = ProbeRsClient(...)  # create an instance of the client
     data = probe_rs_client.read(16, 0x1000, 4)  # read 4 words (64 bits each) starting at address 0x1000
     ```
   - To interact with the device using the CLI:
     ```
     probe_rs_client.cli()  # run the command-line interface
     ```

This Mermaid sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the User, ProbeRsClient, DriverClient, Operator (Operator object from opendal package), and OpenDalAdapter. The diagram demonstrates how functions like `info`, `reset`, `erase`, `download`, and `read` are executed and how they interact with each other.
