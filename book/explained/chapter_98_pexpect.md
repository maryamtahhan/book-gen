## Chapter 98: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/pexpect.py

 The file `jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-driver-network/jumpstarter_driver_network/adapters/pexpect.py` is a Python script that provides an adapter for using the pexpect library within the broader context of the JumpStarter project. This adapter allows for the creation and management of network connections, specifically by utilizing the TcpPortforwardAdapter class to set up port forwarding.

   The key function in this file is `PexpectAdapter`, which creates a context manager (also known as a context libary) that can be used to execute pexpect-based commands over an established network connection. Here's a breakdown of the function:

   1. `with TcpPortforwardAdapter(client=client, method=method) as addr:` sets up a new instance of the `TcpPortforwardAdapter` class with the provided `DriverClient` object and specified method (defaults to "connect"). This adapter handles setting up port forwarding between the local machine and the device connected through the client. The result is an address tuple, `addr`, which contains the remote host and remote port information.

   2. `sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)` creates a new socket object for connecting to the remote server.

   3. `sock.connect(addr)` connects the newly created socket to the address obtained from the `TcpPortforwardAdapter`.

   4. The yield statement returns the pexpect spawned child process, allowing other parts of the code to work with it.

   5. The finally block ensures that the socket is closed after use, releasing any associated resources.

   This adapter fits within the JumpStarter project by providing a simple and consistent way to establish network connections through pexpect for various tasks such as command execution or communication with remote devices. Example use cases might include interacting with a device's command-line interface (CLI) or automating software installations on remote machines.

   For instance, if you have a script that requires executing commands on a remote machine connected through the JumpStarter client, you can wrap those commands within the `PexpectAdapter` context manager as follows:

   ```python
   with PexpectAdapter(client=my_jumpstarter_client) as spawn:
       # Execute commands here using spawn.sendline() and spawn.expect() methods
   ```

    PA->>S: sock.connect(addr)
    S-->>PA: connected to server

    PA->>DC: yield fdspawn(sock)

        DC-->PA: Read, write, send or expect commands
        PA-->DC: Respond accordingly
    end

    PA->>S: close()
    S-->>PA: socket closed

    PA->>DC: close_adapter()
```

This Mermaid diagram represents the interactions between the key functions in the `PexpectAdapter` class. The DriverClient creates an instance of the PexpectAdapter, which in turn creates a socket and connects to the server. The child process spawned by the PexpectAdapter handles read, write, send or expect commands from the DriverClient. Once the connection is closed, the PexpectAdapter cleans up the resources.
