## Chapter 17: jumpstarter/packages/jumpstarter-cli-admin/jumpstarter_cli_admin/get_test.py

 The provided code is a test suite for a command-line tool that interacts with Kubernetes API using the `kubectl`-like syntax. The tests check the functionality of two commands: `get lease` and `get leases`.

   - The `get lease` command fetches details about a specific lease resource, while `get leases` fetches a list of all available lease resources.

   The test suite uses the `unittest.mock` library to mock the Kubernetes API interactions with the `LeasesV1Alpha1Api` class and checks that the output of each command matches the expected results. The tests also check if the JSON and YAML outputs are correct when specified using the `--output` flag, and verify that no leases are returned when there are none available.

   To run these tests, save them in a file (e.g., test_leases.py) and use the following command:

   ```
   python -m unittest test_leases.py
   ```

 The provided code is a set of tests for a command-line utility that interacts with Kubernetes APIs using the `kubernetes-python` library. Here are the functions being tested:

   - `list_leases`: This function lists all leases (resources) in a given namespace.
   - `get`: This is the main command that allows users to list or retrieve specific leases based on their names, or to get a JSON/YAML formatted output of the lease data.

   The tests are checking if the correct lease information is being displayed when the command is run and if the output can be formatted as JSON or YAML.

   To run these tests, you would need to have a test suite set up for this particular project, which includes creating test cases, initializing the required objects (such as `CliRunner`), patching functions using the `patch` decorator, and finally calling the command with the necessary arguments. The test would then check if the output matches the expected result.

   For example, one of the tests for the `get` function checks if the correct lease information is displayed when running the command:

```python
def test_get(capfd):
    # ... (patching functions and setting up a mock response)

    result = runner.invoke(get, ["leases"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    out, err = capfd.readouterr()
    assert "82a8ac0d-d7ff-4009-8948-18a3c5c607b1" in out
    assert "82a8ac0d-d7ff-4009-8948-18a3c5c607b2" in out
    # ... (more asserts to check for other lease information)
```
